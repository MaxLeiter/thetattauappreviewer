So far I have loved meeting fellow female engineers in Women In Engineering, and I’m excited to reach out to even more engineers through Theta Tau. In particular, Theta Tau offers more personal connections for engineers through the social, service, and professionalism activities that so many other clubs don’t push. Even after just meeting a few Theta Tau members at the first event, I can tell that it truly is a community.","If I could plan one event, I would like to allow Theta Tau to become more connected to other majors through social mixers. I think it would be a really cool idea to have a speed-dating-type event where an engineering student and a student of another major can briefly talk about shared interest in different fields and share socials. Some of the coolest projects and connections happen when different disciplines put their interests and abilities together. This event may be considered more professional as well, as students could talk about potential projects at the end with those they clicked well with. 

This event could also open up the possibility of other majors switching into engineering or STEM fields. For students unsure about whether or not they want to switch into engineering, the speed dating rounds could give them ideas about different engineering majors, as well as the types of students they can find in each engineering division. Many students at USC probably perceive the engineers in a different light that we may perceive ourselves, and social mixers or speed dating could help fix that.
","I hope to get the most out of the service pillar, as I deem the purpose of engineering is “solve things to help people”. No matter how creative one is, if creations are selfish then they do not serve the greater Engineering community. I have always wanted to use my degree to make powerful changes to anyone in need. Coming from Boston and being able to attend USC, I recognize that I am privileged. It is important that I use my privilege to aid whoever or whatever needs it. 

By joining Viterbi Impact this semester as well, I am hoping to use two channels of service to help different communities. In VIP, I plan on bringing my experience as a female in engineering to young female students in LA who may need female guidance into a STEM field. In Theta Tau, I aim to bring even more hope to any community that needs either an engineer or simple helping hand.","Austin Powers Gold Member, The Hungry Hungry Caterpillar, The Ring","I strongly relate to April Ludgate from Parks and Recreation. Though I don’t believe I am as edgy, the way she approaches life is very similar to my own approach. We both find ways to make even arduous tasks fun, and treat life like a bowl of opportunities. When i’m faced with long waits, stressful situations, or dry classes, I make the most of the moments with music, laughter, or a dry humor when appropriate. Just like how April does not let bad people or situations effect her, I try to do the same as well.","Here me out: Ethanol can be made within 40-50 hours of dry-miling corn. In the dry milling process, a corn kernel is ground into flour, which is then mashed with water. it goes through fermentation to make CO2, and then distillation produces ethanol. Enzymes are the only added ingredient to the mash to form the starch into simple sugars. Technically, this enzyme can be found in the human body to digest food. That being said, one could spit a bunch into the mash to technically produce ethanol I think (not a chemical engineer sorry). 

Given that the ethanol takes a while to be made, I would use the first 2-3 days to continuously pick corn and produce ethanol in small batches in the mug. Not needing a full gallon of ethanol, I would eat a small subsection of the corn to survive and save a small section each collection as well. The ethanol is what will prepare me to leave.

I believe it would be more intelligent to leave the farm within 3 days, as i would be putting most of my energy into the corn picking and ethanol production. As for water, I would try using the parachute to collect rain water and possibly dig a small well to hold the extra water. Because I would not be focused on lasting there for 10 days, it would be important to leave as soon as possible. 

It takes about 66 hours to walk 200 miles on foot, or 30 hours on horseback. I would use the lasso to try catching a cow or horse, using the apple as bait. Even if an animal was not caught, either route would be faster than waiting the rest of the 7 days for farmers to possibly come back. I would bring enough corn to sustain myself and the animal. Oh and the ethanol is for drinking because this is a stressful situation.",,"Honestly just meeting as many people as I possibly can excites me. Freshman year zoom was incredibly difficult to connect with others, and I found myself feeling extreme “FOMO” for those who were able to stay in LA. Being in my sophomore year, I feel that I need to try extra hard to make up the connections I lost last year. 

I have been to almost every event so far, including roller-blading, the concert, and many many lines. I could care less about the waits, as I’ve talked to some of the coolest people waiting with me for a USC event. It really feels like such a welcoming community of students here, and I’m so excited to finally be part of it :)

Professionally, the additional opportunities to refine my interviewing and application process as well as the additional exposure to employers would be extremely helpful. As a dual benefit, becoming part of such a tight-knit organization serves as a great way to meet people and have fun in addition to the implicit networking benefits."," I would design an event to expose members to a particular area where they would have the opportunity to work post graduation which would be designed based on the profession and social pillars. Over the last few months I have become increasingly aware that once we graduate, we choose where we live by choosing our first job, but it is hard to know what different areas are like. For example of an event, there are lots of computer science jobs in Irvine, so I would plan destinations to go around Irvine. Of course we would visit Technology Way where are lot of companies are located, but I would also choose fun areas to showcase what you would do after work. This might include interesting areas with restaurants or some local attraction that seems interesting. Together this combination of destinations would be a social event with professional implications satisfying the profession and social pillars.","I am looking to get the most out of the social pillar. The pandemic for myself, like many others, was a individual experience. For almost all of COVID I was busy working part-time and going to school which replaced anytime I would have had for friends. For the summer before this semester, I decided to travel around the US--but again I did it alone. While I was traveling, I was reminded through chance interactions and friendships what I was missing out on, and now that I again have the opportunity to engage in the human aspect of college, I believe that Theta Tau would be the best place to socially connect.","Nathan for You, Chappelle's Show, Star Wars the Clone Wars","Nathan from Nathan for You. To start, there are some physical similarities because we are both these relatively tall, skinny white guys with brown hair. Select parts of the character's personality are similar to mine, but definitely not all. I identify with his work ethic and sheer determination throughout the show, but I don't think I have ever been even close to as awkward as he is.","I am in a cornfield, so I would just eat the corn. To take care of water, I would squeeze corn between the two pieces of wood to make corn juice. There might also be some form of irrigation which would also help provide water. Boredom would probably be the biggest challenge. I would starting by making little cornpeople using the rope, ears of corn, and pocketknife. If this goes well, it would be like Wilson the volleyball in Cast Away. Wilson and I would learn how to juggle the soccer ball or maybe play a bit of one-on-one soccer. Afterwards I would make more cornpeople, and basically play dolls with Wilson until we get bored. When this happens, I use the scrap wood and match to light a fire to burn the field. The farmers would either come early or Wilson and I would have fun playing with the fire.",,"I touched on this in my previous answer to what pillar I am looking to get the most out of, but I am looking forward to the human aspect of college. During the pandemic professional and academic development never stopped for me, but the human interaction did.

After the information session, I instantly knew I wanted to join the warm community of Theta Tau. Within an hour, I had argued with Rithika and Neha about the concept of a loveseat, laughed with Ariana about the enigma of Cote and reminisced with Amanda on trying to spend our mentorship money. I love that everyone is a genuinely kind person I could easily strike a conversation and laugh with, and that everyone constantly builds each other up and has a uniquely inspiring story to tell.","I would plan a Service event! After my WRIT 150 class on community engagement, where I studied various forms of community service, I realized that community service is most effective through sustained long-term involvement with the community rather than a singular volunteer event. Thus, I would plan a service event that could lead to potential long-term involvement and provide volunteers with outlets to understand the community more deeply.

I’ve also been passionate about creating a supportive environment for females in STEM. For a service event, I would reach out to local high schools and advertise 3-4 hour after-school homework sessions for females struggling in STEM classes at a location nearby. Volunteers could sign up for convenient times to help students with their homework or answer any questions, perhaps about college applications or career trajectories. Through consistent homework sessions, volunteers could build bonds with the high-school students and learn about other difficulties they may face, potentially paving the way to other kinds of volunteer events. We could follow this up with volunteer meetings, where we discuss difficulties the students face, perhaps creating programs & events or finding resources to tackle other issues these high schoolers face.","I think the Social pillar is the most important. There are many clubs that host Service and Professional-related events, yet I’ve grown to realize it’s the people in the club that make up those events and make the club great. I’m passionate about all pillars and love that Theta Tau ties them together, yet I think the Social aspect is what bonds the members and keeps them coming back to make these events fun and engaging as well.

Additionally, in my past two years at USC, I’ve experimented with various clubs and learned that a strong identification with the club’s purpose and a strong community that I enjoy being with is most important. Not only do I identify with the pillars and events Theta Tau hosts, I also love the supportive community it creates, and would love to help foster it through attending and hosting events. I’m also awed by how each person has an inspiring story and unique interests beyond the engineering field, and how I can easily hold a conversation about virtually any topic and hear an entertaining answer.","Tuesdays with Morrie, The Power of Now, Bojack Horseman","I relate to Jim from The Office in certain ways. Like him, sometimes my daily life can be mundane and dreary, yet I feel like the beauty of life comes from the seemingly ordinary moments: spontaneously getting coffee with a roommate, playing TypeRacer in class, catching the sunset on a walk home. In fact, the highlight of my month was a sweaty afternoon when my two roommates and I decided to carry a sofa 0.5 miles home - something we were severely untrained for. Like Jim, I’ve realized it really is the little moments - and laughs - in life that matter.","Well, there’s no time to waste - I’d find civilization myself!

First, I’d take the match and a piece of wood to light a fire underneath the parachute. Then, I’d take the lasso and tie it around the parachute (with the fire inside) to make a makeshift parachute. I’d then try to tie the other piece of wood to the lasso as a tiny platform to rest on, or hang onto the rope with hopefully immense arm strength from years of weight training.

The other supplies are for my flight to civilization. Higher elevation means a colder climate, so I’d put on my snowshoes on my feet or head. The mug could come in handy to catch condensation or precipitation in case I pass through some clouds. The apple could serve as nourishment; I’d cut it in 4 with my knife and ration it out for 4 days.

For entertainment, I’d settle with cloud watching; I’m sure seeing the clouds up close would be pretty awe-inspiring for a few days. Next, the tweezers and mirrors would be for looking presentable when nearing civilization; I wouldn’t want to scare them away. Lastly, if I spot an unsuspecting person below, I’d attract their attention by dropping the soccer ball, hopefully alerting them that I need help.",,"I’m looking forward to so many things, but I’m most excited about lifting more consistently and seeing progress. I’d always wanted to start lifting consistently, but struggled with constant gym intimidation at the USC gyms. When COVID hit, I unfortunately had to stop completely.

The co-ed and open STEM major inclusion of theta tau allows me to build relationships with a very diverse group of people and expand my relationships in not only Viterbi, but in also different schools within USC. From the recruitment events I have gone to, I really experience a family connection between everyone who thrives on seeing each other succeed and I would love to be a part of that.","Out of the three pillars of Theta Tau, I would plan an event on Social where members go to thrift stores and shop for each other! Having a love for thrifting, clothing, and fashion, I know some great thrift spots in LA that I would take members to and have them make outfits for the other person. Members could pair up and be given a time limit to find an outfit for the other person that could either be way out of their comfort zone or just simply switching up their style. If you're tired of a certain member wearing the same shirt and shorts every day, this is your time to give them an entire fashion transformation. Thrifting is a great way to shop sustainably and is a really entertaining activity with friends. And of course, as we go to these stores, you are also more than welcome to just simply shop for yourselves in revamping your own style. Overall, thrifting is great way to find staple pieces for a lower cost and the beauty of finding amazing pieces with friends makes the clothes you find so much more valuable.","I feel that the most important pillar to me is Social. Although all three pillars are equally significant to Theta Tau, the aspect of lifelong friends and a family bond is something that is not replicable in other organizations or programs that I have experienced. Throughout the meetings, there is an apparent connection and chemistry between members that I really admire. With the other pillars, I feel that service and professionalism are aspects that can be found and achieved through other clubs, but with the social pillar, relationships and bonds like these are not easily found in other organizations. The active members that I have met throughout the whole recruitment process have made me feel so comfortable and welcome which really portrays the type of loving environment that is cultivated within Theta Tau. There is a clear, genuine want in striving to help each other succeed and the support within this community is what I look forward to. The lifelong connections and strong encouragement of growth that Theta Tau presents speaks to me the most and therefore, the Social pillar is the most important pillar to me.","Criminal Minds (TV show), Film for Her (Book), and Veronica Mars (TV show)","The fictional character that best represents me is Emily Prentiss from the show Criminal Minds. Emily Prentiss is a character with many layers of being spearheaded yet vulnerable. We both share having a hard exterior of being strong and resilient individuals, but with a soft interior of being great listeners who empathize with others. When put in difficult situations, we both weigh all our options thoroughly to find resourceful solutions and communicate honestly with others. Just like Emily, I enjoy messing with my friends out of love, and will stand up for them through thick and thin.","I’d first establish a goal to get to civilization as quickly as possible. In this situation, I have two options of leaving or staying. Leaving presents more uncertainty, but more opportunity while staying provides more security but less possibility and control since you are reliant on others. Also, walking to civilization would probably take less time than waiting for the farmers which shortens the amount of time I’d be stranded for. Assuming I had a full course meal before, I would choose the option to leave because one, I’d have the energy to walk, two, there are more possibilities of finding my horse or finding other civilization, and three, I’d rather act and try to do something than do nothing and rely on being saved. However, before leaving the junkyard with all my stuff, I would prepare for travel by collecting as much corn as possible for food and leaving a message by finding scrap metal and etching a note saying ""left to find help in this direction --->"" using the swiss army knife so that I could be found. For shelter, I would use the parachute to make a tent and for warmth, the mirror would be used by reflecting the sun’s rays to make fires every night. To keep myself entertained, I would use the lasso and scrap wood to make a mini soccer net to learn to kick a soccer ball with more accuracy and hopefully, my optimism will be the reason I end up surviving.",,"Besides seeing everyone on campus, I am most looking forward to working on my undergraduate research project with my professor and his team. Our project focuses on the World Health Organization system's impact and response on COVID-19 and we analyze the WHO's whole process on handling the pandemic.

The three pillars of Theta Tau greatly appeal to me, it’s everything I’m looking for in a campus organization. I love how collaborative Theta Tau is and how members help each other succeed, from mock interviews to resume reviews to getting advice from Theta Tau alumni. The service pillar drew me in as well, I’ve worked with kids before and know how much they enjoy STEM. The social aspect especially seems like a blast.","An event that I’d be interested in planning is going to a local soup kitchen or food bank where we would help prepare and serve the food for people in need. Not only is it a great way to serve the local community, but it will give us the opportunity to bond by working together as well. We would divide up into four groups, each with a different task to perform. One group would be responsible for food prep, whether it be chopping the vegetables and meat or portioning the food. The second group would be responsible for cooking the food, from stir-frying to steaming. The third group would be responsible for serving the food and making sure everyone is getting what they need in the front of house. The fourth group will be responsible for washing dishes that come in throughout the service and keeping the back of house clean. And if we have any members who have experience baking or making desserts we could have a fifth group who would do that. Finally, at the end of service, we would all clean up together as a group.","The social aspect of Theta Tau was definitely the most appealing to me initially. Being a part of a diverse community of like-minded individuals is something that I’m seeking. I’m looking forward to getting to know all the members of Theta Tau. With so many different people from different backgrounds with varying interests, I’m sure that I’ll get introduced to new things by members and hope to return the favor as well. I hope to meet members with similar interests too, so I can have some hiking and eating buddies or just have people to talk about hip-hop, movies, or basketball with. The collaborative community and culture really drew me to Theta Tau, I love how helpful members are to one another. With many members of Theta Tau being transfers I know that if I ever have any questions I can seek them for advice. Being part of such a great community, I know that I can look to Theta Tau members if I ever have questions about classes or to even grab lunch or go to the gym together. The social events all seem like a great time, especially the retreat, where I’d get the chance to bond even further.","The Farewell, Spirited Away, Master of None","I think that Sokka from Avatar the Last Airbender represents me pretty well. He is very goofy and sarcastic, always cracking jokes even when it might be the wrong time. He is very caring to the people close to him, always having Aang and Katara’s back when they need it. And as the series progressed, he became more accepting and open-minded, eventually befriending Zuko. Sokka is very optimistic, always having hope even if the odds are against him. And despite not being able to bend, his resourcefulness and creativity got him far. Such as when he tricked people into thinking Katara could earth bend.","First I’d work on my sleeping situation, I would use the swiss army knife to cut off corn stalks and use them as make-shift tent poles. I would make sure to cut off the leaves on the corn stalk since I wouldn’t want it getting in my face when I sleep. After I have all my tent poles I’d cut up the parachute and make it into the tent. If there’s any leftover material from the parachute I would use it as a blanket. If there isn’t any leftover material then I’d try my best to weave a blanket using the corn husk and silk. And while I’m at it I’d make a pillow and sleeping mat the same way too. 
I wouldn’t want to eat raw corn for 10 days so I’d roast as much corn as I can with the single match I have. I would first disassemble the snowshoe so only the metal frame would remain, which I would use as a grill to roast the corn on. For the fire, I would use corn silk and husk to get the fire started then I’d add the scraps of wood I have. I would try my best to ration the water and food I have left and the apple as well since those will be my main source of water. 
To keep me entertained I would use the soccer ball, lasso, and corn stalk for a makeshift tetherball pole. Finally, just in case the farmer misses me I’d use the mirror to reflect the sunlight to get their attention.",,"I’m looking forward to making the best of the upcoming school year. Since I’m a transfer and it’s my first year at USC I’m really looking forward to meeting new people and making new friends.

The most brilliant engineer can only accomplish so much without teamwork. Through interacting with active members I felt welcomed to a team of people focused on what really matters, brotherhood and impact. Theta Tau’s pillars of Service, Professionalism, and Social, combine to create a place where engineers become the type of person I aspire to be.
","If I could plan one event for Theta Tau it would be a Habitat for Humanity (HFHI) build. HFHI is a non-profit organization building affordable homes that give struggling families a helping hand. Individuals selected are able to buy the house built through extremely affordable mortgages at no profit to HFHI with the intent of giving those struggling a way out while simultaneously teaching valuable financial skills. 

A HFHI build would be a fantastic event for Theta Tau in every pillar (Service, Professionalism, and Social). HFHI’s unique solution is particularly relevant in the Los Angeles area due to the homeless crisis. Regarding professionalism, a build allows participants to reinforce the soft skills of teamwork, communication, and project budget allocation on a hands-on impactful level. These skills are integral in the success of members post graduation in professional and personal life. Lastly, regarding social, what is more fun to an engineer than hanging out with friends and sharing the satisfaction and camaraderie of building something. Many engineers love to work together on side projects, so why not have it change someone's life?
","Service is the most important pillar to me as I believe it is the foundation of the other pillars. In my eyes, service is not just attending a volunteer event but a lens to view the world around you. In leadership, the aim is to serve the people around you. Subordinates are not below you, but the people you should be working for. Service is essential to brotherhood.We must serve each other to earn the trust that fortifies relationships for both good and bad times. 
	As an engineer, we are empowered to study skills that physically change the world around us. Whether one’s dream is creating the world’s next big startup or working for a globally recognized enterprise, acting through service not only makes the world better, but leads to the greatest return of success. How can I use my skills to solve the struggles of my peers and those in need? Answering that question has resulted in countless commercial and ethical successes in history. I aim to savor Theta Tau’s opportunity to join a brotherhood that is like minded in this stance and influence the community and world around us.

While I will likely never be as wise, empathetic, or knowledgeable as Uncle Iroh, he is the framework for who I aim to grow into. Iroh had the skill of influencing those around him for positive change which is always at the forefront of my mind. As I move forward, I work to be able to mentor those around me to become leaders as Iroh does. 
","First thing I would do is start shucking corn and trying to find dry husks. Corn can be used as fuel for a fire and be started with dry husks. I could keep this fire alight for 10 days with “unlimited” fuel. 
Next for water, since ideally this is fertile farmland, there must be some sort of water source close as wildlife need to drink somewhere. If I can’t find a source then rain must be common since corn needs water. I would hang my parachute and make a small hole in the middle that would collect rainwater into my mug. 
Food would be my next target. Considering I am in a sweet corn field (traditional corn fields have inedible corn that is mainly used for ethanol production) I could start roasting corn on my fire using a stick. Additionally, regardless of my corn field status, I could use my apple as bait and use my lasso to catch interested wildlife. Then I can use my swiss army knife, stick, and a fire to prepare it. 
For entertainment, I could whittle my scrap wood using my knife for sculptures or even tools to help me with any of my other tasks. I could use the ball to practice my soccer because I am terrible or use the snow shoes to play “keep it up” . 
Lastly, when I see the farmer in view I can use my mirror as a signal that I am stranded and flag for help.

I look forward to growing my skills of problem solving and engineering to create impact. I look forward to refining my mentorship as a resident advisor helping individuals grapple with their new adult life. I look forward to growing my ability to inspire others as a future combat leader in NROTC. Finally, I look forward to the lessons found in the brotherhood  of Theta Tau.

While those qualities are important and vital to anyone joining a professional fraternity, the real reason I want to join Theta Tau is its adamancy on expanding its outreach and sharing its values. I find the stride quite endearing and a true testament to the framework of the fraternity. Theta Tau's ever increasing rate of new student memberships and prime focus on its pillars single it out from other fraternities and organizations.","During my junior and senior years of high school, I volunteered in a campaign titled ""The Water Bottle Campaign"" where student-led groups would distribute water bottles to public workers. The student leadership aspect of the campaign helped everyone maximize their leadership and management skills to their full extent. Since Service and Profession are intrinsic parts of the Theta Tau initiative, the event I plan would harken the aforementioned core elements of the Water Bottle Campaign so that it would contribute to both pillars.

The event would go along the lines of a ""Creative Engineers for the Future"" campaign. In this campaign, student-led groups would brainstorm ideas and suggestions while using engineering resources and tools to come up with simple yet effective creations that would help the general public. Each group would be dedicated to a specific public community and would come up with inventions that appeal to their specific interests to hopefully make their lives easier.","I find the pillar of Professionalism the most vital to me personally. Besides the fact that I am a self-proclaimed perfectionist, most of my peers; both professional and non-professional, like to refer to me as detail-oriented and businesslike. I find those qualities important to my outward perception as I put an excessive amount of thought and energy into presenting myself with utmost professionalism and a pristine sense of self.

I think those attributes leverage themselves well in the engineering industry, or any formal environment for that matter. They outline personal development in the professional realm and aid in unleashing other traits that deem themselves well fit in said professional environment. For that sake, I hope that Theta Tau further propels me into that standard of professionalism that I am insistingly seeking by aiding me in naturally improving my communication, leadership, and critical thinking skills.","The Good Place, You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay, How to Teach Quantum Physics to Your Dog by Chad Orzel","I recently watched the live-action movie Cruella and was entranced by Cruella deVil's character. She is unapologetic, driven with ambition, and knows what she wants. She reminded me of myself in regard to my fearless outlook on life. The same way she reclaims her power and strength, I work towards achieving higher levels of my inner strength. The same way she exhibits hidden talents and ambitions, I gate-keep my best abilities only to shock people with them later on. Through all the tribulations she has been through, she continues to crawl back into the spotlight and reinvent herself. ","Since I would be in a cornfield, my food supply would not be too much of an issue. However, I would find it a necessity to have a roof (or somewhat of a roof) above my head for the duration of these ten days. Therefore, instead of using the scrap wood to start a bonfire like what would be assumed, I would use the two pieces in conjunction with a deployed parachute to create my own tent; where the pieces of scrap wood act as supports. To keep the pieces of scrap wood standing firm, I would wrap the lasso around the pieces in such a way where the pieces would pull on each other and restrict each other from moving. To provide the tent with extra support, I would cut holes in the lower back end of the parachute to stick the snowshoes in and shove them into the ground. I would use the swiss army knife to cut the soccer ball in half so that I can have a plate to eat off of (with the swiss army knife acting as the cutlery) and would use the apple to plant its seeds if I get too bored from eating corn. If a situation occurred where a random source started emitting light, I would use the mirror to reflect that light back as an SOS signal so that any bystander following it can rescue me.",,"As an international student, I am excited to become a part of the campus community. I think meeting new people and making connections is an important aspect of college life and, coupled with my introduction to a different cultural dynamic, is going to provide me with a new perception on people's behavioral and social dynamics. I can learn a lot from other people, especially when they come from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds that I do not know much about.

I can tell Theta Tau offers a community where I’d be able to make new friends, feel welcomed, and attend a host of events across all of Theta Tau’s pillars. By joining, I know I’ll instantly gain a network of people who are always going to be there for me providing support however I need it. Theta Tau seems to be the perfect middle ground between having fun with others and focusing on important aspects of life like finding success in my career and helping the community.
","I think bowling could be a super fun social event. Theta Tau could reserve part of a bowling alley. Everyone would meet up and compete and the winner receives a prize which could be something like money, trophy, gift card, etc.. Optionally, the last place team could have to do some sort of forfeit if it’s agreed upon by everyone.

Now some people probably are much better at bowling than others, so to make it fair it would be a team event where most experienced are paired with the least experienced. Each team would play two or three rounds of bowling with different groups each time. After all the teams have played their rounds, the scores from all games would be added together and the top two teams would move on to the finals. These two teams would play in a three round sudden death match with everyone watching to determine the winner. 

Everyone loves a game of bowling every now and then, so I think this event would be super fun and would encourage friendly competition amongst the Theta Tau members. And nothing is more intense than a sudden death final match with everyone watching.
","Although all of the pillars are very important to me, I think I want to get the most out of the social aspect. As I attended Theta Tau’s events and saw the positive community formed between the members, it was definitely something I could see myself being a part of. Being able to meet and make lifelong relationships with a variety of fun and interesting people across Viterbi is an opportunity I don’t want to pass up. And seeing the social events like the paint party and retreats looked like a great way to alleviate some of the stress of college.

And beyond just attending fun events, the social aspect of Theta Tau means I’ll instantly gain a network of fellow engineering students, many of whom are in computer science. I know I’ll always have someone to go to if I’m struggling with any concepts or have any questions about a class. 

This extends to my career as well. Networking is one of the most important parts of getting the job you want. Having a group of friends with experience and connections all across the computer science industry is something only possible by joining the Theta Tau community.","Space Jam, Silicon Valley, Black Mirror","My favorite show (other than the final season) is Game of Thrones. While watching, one character who really resonated with me was Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion is a dwarf and that means he’s constantly dismissed in Westeros. Despite a small stature, his actions cast a large shadow through his wit and intelligence. I relate to Tyrion as he doesn’t use brute force to solve problems but thinks outside the box using intellect to find the hidden solution only he can craft. His quick thinking and the creative way he plays the Game of Thrones are both aspects I really respect and personally connected with.","Straight away, I’m taking the parachute, cutting it with the knife, and making it into a few makeshift bags to carry all the other supplies. Then, I head back to the cornfield and pick as much corn as I can carry and put them into my parachute bags. Since I know the area, I head to the closest forest that also has a water source nearby. 

I find a flat and comfortable spot in the forest and because I still have a bit of food and water left, I spend the rest of the day gathering sticks and creating a shelter. I’ll use the straps and netting from the snowshoes to tie everything together and create something that leans against a tree and covers me from above.  With the match and scrap wood, I create a fire to keep me warm and while it’s going, learn to start a fire with collected sticks.

On day two, I head back to the cornfield with my bags and collect as much more corn as possible. Since raw corn is still edible, this will be my food over the next ten days. After that, I take the bags to the closest water source and fill them up fully; I can scoop the water out with my mug to drink when I’m at my shelter.

Now that I have food, shelter, and water by the end of day two, I have eight days left to entertain myself. To do this I split my time between three activities, soccer, lassoing, and jump rope (which I make by cutting the lasso).",,"Getting the on campus experience is definitely what I’m most excited about. I took a leave of absence all of last school year because you miss out on so much being online. Getting to actually interact with classmates instead of their small virtual box, meeting others in my apartment building, attending welcome events, etc. have all been great experiences that are only possible in person.

I’ve found that there is no substitute for internal USC advice coming directly from other more experienced engineering students. So, in addition to the academic and professional support network Theta Tau can provide, I’m looking the most forward to learning as much as I can about Viterbi through member’s first hand experiences. ","I’m usually the friend in my friend group that organizes the social events, so I think I would be good at organizing a social event for Theta Tau. Drinking and partying is nice, but I’ve found that after a long week of working in front of a computer screen, many of my engineering friends feel like they need to escape to the outdoors. The most refreshing trip I had was during first semester finals sophomore year when I organized a trip up to lake arrowhead after a big snow storm. We spend the day sledding down the golf course, having snowball fights, and building a 10 foot tall snowman that we named Ice Ice Baby. Then we had an early dinner at a cheap but yummy Italian restaurant and left in time to drive down the mountain and watch the sun set. It was a quick, easy, and cheap day trip (10am-6pm) and all my friends, myself included, felt like the trip breathed life back into our motivation to study and kill it on our final exams. Would highly recommend.","Social. I feel as engineers, we tend to underplay the importance of networking in the professional sphere, but as the industry gets more competitive, it is more imperative than ever to have a solid network of like minded, high achieving individuals. While many of my friends are already engineers, I think that the more people you know, the more you can learn from them, the more opportunities you have to grow, and the more connections you can leverage in the professional world. And unlike a standard friend group, Theta Tau sounds like it emphasizes and encourages members to share their experiences in academics and industry with other members. From the events that I have attended, Theta Tau members sound highly motivated, involved, and all around knowable and I would love to learn more about everyone. To me, this is some of the most valuable information I can gleam here with my time at USC. In addition, Theta Tau members seem like a lot of fun and the idea of having 40+ life long, like-minded friends sounds amazing to me. ","Rango, Game Night, Love Death & Robots. ","Currently, I feel like I most identify with Barry B. Benson. I can relate to his struggle to figure out what path he should take in his life, whether he should be a stirrer or a pollen jock, ext. I am likely Barry’s age in human equivalency and I too am pressed to decide my career direction. Additionally, although Barry is just a bee, he is still able to elicit massive change in his community through intelligence, charming persuasion, and positivity. Although he makes a major mistake in the process, he owns up and corrects it with gusto. ","In a survival situation, my first course of action would be to secure a viable source of water. Assuming that this is still a functional cornfield with live, growing corn, I would locate the irrigation system and use the swiss army knife to puncture a hole in the irrigation tubing and use the mug to capture the water. Boom. Water. As for food, again assuming this is a functional cornfield, I will have an infinite supply of raw corn, which although lacks protein, is an excellent source of carbohydrates and should sustain me for 10 days. Nice. Food. My next priority would be to build a temporary shelter. I would use the parachute as a tarp and drape it over the corn stalks, which on average in Kansas, grow about 6 ft tall, and I would trample the middle section so that there is a nice bed of leaves instead of dirt and room for me to stand. TMZ welcome to my crib. My final priority would be to search for rescue since I can only stand eating corn for 5 days. I would trample portions of the field to write “HELP” so that passing aircrafts can spot my location (if I’m bored enough, fashion a crop circle so that the History Chanel comes to investigate). To further aid in my rescue, I would use the mirror to reflect the sun directly at passing aircraft cockpits to get their attention. If I’m stranded in the winter though… I’m screwed.",,"I’m especially excited for this upcoming school year since we will at long last be returning to campus in person. Here are some of the things I look forwards to experiencing once again: Game days, Taco Zone, late night down town LA trips, surfing Porto, skating down McClintock, studying in the village, Trader Joes lines (sike), sporadic college student social decisions, LA squirrels, in person labs, saying hi to DPS, friends in close proximity, Parkside dim sum, Kogi truck, lime scooters, fryft, movie nights with the homies, ext.

I want to grow professionally while having lots of fun throughout the school year, and from what I’ve seen from the Group, Theta Tau is a safe space to do these sorts of things. The past couple of years have taught me to be ok with being alone, making the transition to USC more manageable. As activities come back in person, I would love to get involved and join Theta Tau to take advantage of my time at USC.","An event that I would plan for the organization is to coordinate with alumni to host a mock interview and elevator pitch session in a semi casual environment. It would most likely occur in one of the larger classrooms where we could clear out desks to allow for a career fair-like environment. The event wouldn’t have to be with alumni, but I feel like involving the alumni could be a  fun and approachable experience for members and allow for a social aspect of the event after the more professional portion of the event is concluded. USC offers these types of events, but allowing Theta Tau alumni to be involved would make the experience feel more personal and constructive than having it conducted by an unfamiliar industry professional. I also feel that the event can be taken seriously without causing too much stress for people who are not as familiar with networking and interview skills.","I feel that the most important pillar to me is professionalism. Although USC provides an environment that allows students to develop independence and responsibility, professionalism in preparing for the workplace is not emphasized in classrooms. Although I have interviewed for clubs and part time positions, I don’t think that I have been prepared for, or been given the expectations for getting hired at a company. I have not given recruitment, and other career concerns too much thought, however, the time has really flown by, and I hope to be able to get extra support from Theta Tau and little pieces of advice from its members this coming semester. I would be very excited to get involved in the social and service-oriented portions of Theta Tau, but the pillar that I hope to get the most out of is the professional aspect. 
","Guardians of the Galaxy, Superbad, New Girl","The fictional character that best represents me would be Jake the dog from Adventure time. Jake is a magical dog who lives with his adopted brother Finn the human, and goes on adventures in a post-apocalyptic magical world. Jake is very carefree despite being a father of five and takes life very casually. He can be very eccentric and emotional at times and has very funny out-of-pocket moments, but in the end, he is always a good reliable friend. He also gets deep sometimes and gives strange but wise life advice, but only occasionally when he isn’t goofing around. He also loves cooking which is a similar passion of mine.","In this situation, cornfields have irrigation systems, so accessing water wouldn’t be an issue as long as you could get a good vantage point from the junkyard to find the watering devices and use the mug. Raw corn is also edible, so food isn’t an issue other than getting tired of eating only corn and a single apple. With the necessities of food and water taken care of, we can focus on the only thing that matters in this situation: being comfortable and entertained. First, I would find an area near the irrigation system consisting mainly of dirt and clear a space large enough with the swiss army knife to pitch a makeshift tent. I would cut the strings from the parachute using the swiss army knife so that only the fabric remains, and I would cut a small portion out to use as a blanket. I would use the snowshoes to dig holes for the two wooden planks to be placed into and tie them to opposite sides of the parachute using the cut strings. I would weigh the other two sides down using dirt. I would also use the snowshoes to make a soft mound of dirt to sleep and sit on. For entertainment, I would improve my soccer ball juggling skills. I would tie the lasso around the ball and tie the remainder around my waist so that I can juggle without having to retrieve the ball. I’d also light the match and use it to burn a face onto the ball to give castaway vibes. Once the ten days have passed, I’d find a good vantage point and use the mirror as a signal for the farmers to come to fetch me.

","The principle I would choose would be Service, and one event that I would choose would be an engineering-based fundraiser. I have seen various different inventions and showcases of machinery both in and out of USC, so I think doing something similar to that but with profit incentive would be a good idea. The event would be to showcase some of Theta Tau's projects and some things we could work on (ex. games, gadgets, videos, devices, etc.) and give an option for people to donate some money to go to a certain charity organization. For bigger models and/or devices you can actually use, there could also be a very small fee to test the equipment out that would then also go to proceeds for the charity.","I believe that the pillar of Service is the most important to me, and the one that I would hope to get the most out of. On various occasions my friends and teachers have said that I have a bit of a natural inclination to serve others and be of service, and I believe that those words ring quite true- I have been a part of multiple service/compassion clubs and have both planned and participated in a plethora of service opportunities. Serving those in the community and those in need have been very important aspects of my life, as I love to see the number of smiles on people's faces from just a simple act of kindness. I believe that through service, this community and the world as a whole would be exponentially improved.","How to Train your Dragon, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Frindle","One fictional character that may best represent me is Hiro from Big Hero 6. I definitely don't have his smarts or full engineering capabilities, but the way in which he takes most things in stride and uses his gifts/abilities to directly tackle problems and help others along the way connects with how I want to live my life. His willingness to improve and learn from his mistakes and then use the things he learned along the way to better his character and mindset is often how I get through life, and I'd like to base a lot of myself around his positive qualities.","Being in the middle of a cornfield in Kansas, I assume I would have to eat corn for most of the 10 days and find water during rainstorms or ponds (stored using the mug and/or parachute). The parachute would be to store the bigger items when not in use, although I'd have to be careful about the snowshoes and wood because they may have a sharp edge or splinters. I'd save the apple for as long as I could without it going rotten (around 5-7 days, probably) and take bites of it periodically to keep me going. I would use the parachute as a blanket and the soccer ball as a pillow for cold nights. The swiss army jack knife would be used for any maintenance on the other objects if need be, and also to possibly whittle the scrap wood into something useful like a spear or other. If there were any animals that were big enough to eat, I would attempt to use the lasso to rope them in and the swiss army jack knife to kill, skin, and eat the animal. If ever the jack knife gets dull or broken, I could use either the sharp edge of the snowshoes or crack the mirror (hopefully it won't come to that for fear of bad luck) to use as a sharp edge. If there were any big winds/tornados nearby, I could possibly rig the parachute, the snowshoes and the scraps of wood to make a sort of paragliding sail to bring me closer to the civilization. The tweezers would be used if I ever got splinters or if there are small bugs that I could eat somehow. The single strike-anywhere match would be my last ditch effort if anything goes south and I have to have warmth or something.",,"I am most looking forward to using the knowledge I gain in classes to benefit the larger community, as well as making new friends and forming a network of people I can trust in order to work together on our visions and make the world a better place.",Yes,"Sep 8th, 2:00pm",He/Him

My dream at college was to find others with greater expertise than I in many fields, and pick their brains apart and share my knowledge as well. The actives I have met at the recruitment events are such brilliant individuals whom I would wish to work alongside. The social and service aspect of Theta Tau also resonate with me, with those events reinvigorating me to pursue my passions and connect with others in a more impactful way.","Under all three pillars, my event would be a seminar for students entering technology sectors about ethical decision making and understanding the impacts of how our creations may have unintended side-effects. Ideally, this would be through a partnership with the Computer Science department, extending my reach beyond Theta Tau’s influence and out across the entire school. The program would be multi-faceted, with presentations, group discussions, brainstorming solutions and potential issues, and possibly experts in the field appearing as guest speakers. The event would focus on the current trends in various fields and how the success in those fields are spawning multiple issues far beyond the scope the product/idea was created to solve. For instance, the expansion of social media services driving increasing amounts of watch time/user input is creating a more divided world, both socially and ideologically. This issue could be tackled in many ways, such as changing the money-making method away from advertisements and toward a sort of subscription service, allowing these platforms to not drive excessive user commitment. Or, further work could be implemented to restrict usage of these services to individuals during developmental periods in their lives. Another possibility is to encourage the recommendation algorithms to change its traditional feeds of increasingly similar content, instead drafting up a more varied plate of media to consume, mitigating the potential echo-chamber effect. This sort of top-down ethical decision-making would be the core theme of such an event. Obviously, an event of this manner is an ideal one for me, and likely not one I would enact as my first attempt at organizing such an event. But it would definitely be an end goal to influence ethical technological decision making in such a grand manner.","I would say that the Service pillar is the most important, as it's the meeting point between the two other pillars. The Social pillar allows us to understand others, creating connections that enable us to understand and subsequently solve issues they may face. The Professional pillar allows us to sharpen up our business skills in order to access the resources necessary to solve such issues. The Service pillar is where it all comes together, creating a tool, building a facility, or drumming up an idea for the betterment of our communities, the world, or simply an individual. I hope to gain a greater grasp on this more practically translation of the ideas in my head into workable, timely things able to make a change for the better.
    Of course, I still hope to get much out of the social aspect of Theta Tau. Being able to create lasting friendships with like-minded engineers would be great honestly. Plus, an audience like that would allow for such interesting and profound conversations, and that’s definitely something to look forward to.","""Candide"" by Voltaire - ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" by Erich Maria Remarque - ""Pokémon the Series: XY"" by The Pokemon Company International","I feel as though I am best represented by Horatio from Hamlet. As one of my favorite novels/plays, Horatio’s journey is a familiar one to me. As a noble and upstanding denizen of Elsinore, he remains throughout my play as Hamlet’s only true friend. He is constantly supportive of him and never plays others for his own personal gain. By the end of the story, he is firmly by Hamlet’s side, trying to help him until his demise, where he then goes on to recount his story and set the record straight. I see Horatio as an idealized version of myself, as I often find myself in the greatest comfort with those traditionally ostracized by the world, and fighting to have them seen as they are, not by what they should.","Beginning with my basic physiological needs, since I am stranded in a corn field, both food and water would be easy to acquire. Finding and breaking several sprinkler heads would supply me with enough drinking water for well over the 10 days. Besides eating the ubiquitous corn, removing the scarecrows and capturing the birds with the parachute would supply me with much needed protein. Moving next onto safety, constructing a shelter would be my next task. Clearing out the corn stalks would supply me with enough plant fibers and construction materials to build a lean-two type structure that could raise me off of the cold ground. Using the parachute as a makeshift sleeping bag, resting within the shelter would protect me from the elements, especially the harsh winds. Using the weeds as tinder and the leftover stalks as fuel, I would use the match to keep a fire going as long as I can sustain it. With all aspects of my immediate survival solved, I’d begin thriving. For me, this would be fulfilled by the scarecrows. Utilizing all of the items at the junkyard and the scarecrows, I would assemble the ScareSquad©. The sheriff Todd, equipped with his lasso, keeps the peace in Cornutopia. Chet, the cool, sporty fella always cracking jokes while slinging his soccer ball.

I wasn’t sure what the hype was about at first, but upon going to my first ever Theta Tau event (speed-dating), I understood immediately that the bond beyond members ran far deeper than just peers helping each other out. During the four-minute rounds, the actives would overhear each others’ conversations and make a snarky comment or crack a joke, and it was so heartwarming to be a part of that for even two hours of that night. ","I hope to get the most out of the Professionalism pillar of Theta Tau. Being a Viterbi student is tough mentally sometimes because you can’t help but compare yourself to all your peers on LinkedIn, especially those with research and internship positions in their freshman year, a 4.0 GPA, and who somehow personally know Bill Gates. The past year was not great academically for me, and I wasn’t able to snag an internship position over the summer. And I won’t lie, my self-esteem took a huge hit, making me spiral into this whole spiel about how I shouldn’t even try when I’m competing against people who have coded since the womb. The Professionalism pillar speaks to me the most because networking and interview skills aren’t exactly something you can improve on on your own. It takes messing up a lot, like spelling ‘detail-oriented’ on your resume that you’ve already sent out wrong (this actually happened), and recounting your embarrassments to your friends for them – and yourself – to learn. Theta Tau provides a community of people who are just like me, clueless and a bit intimidated, and those who have survived the sometimes soul-crushing process and lived to tell the tale. And I hope I can be a part of that. ","I would reach out to homeless shelters nearby to plan a resource drive, where people could donate essential items, such as towels, toothbrushes, and non-perishable foods. I always hear people say that USC is in a bad and unsafe neighborhood, which stigmatizes the homeless population in downtown LA that most of us have encountered before. Though unintentional, these comments harm an already marginalized community and dehumanize them, making it harder for them to receive the support they need to get back on their feet. 
The drive would probably be set up somewhere with a decent amount of traffic, likely at Trousdale Parkway, and for multiple days so that people can go to the store and come back the next day when they have classes. I think it’d be nice to have a box in the lobby of student housing, like Century or Cale and Irani, with a sign that asks for donations too. If that isn’t permitted, flyers can be put up by members of Theta Tau near their residences to spread the word, on top of the obvious social media sharing. 
During such trying times like these, it’s especially important for us to think about those less fortunate than ourselves. And I truly believe that USC students want to help, but am not sure of how to, this event would solve that problem for them.
","How I Met Your Mother, Lola and the Boy Next Door, Bojack Horseman","The first character that comes to mind is Killua from Hunter x Hunter, because I feel like the dynamic between Gon and Killua reminds me of my friendship with my best friend – she thinks with her heart and is an impulsive risk-taker, whereas I’m more logical and wary of new adventures. They balance each other out well, pushing each other out of their comfort zones and making compromises. (I know this question is supposed to be about just me, but I don’t think I could describe myself without her.)","I think survival wouldn’t be too big of an issue with a cornfield around me, as I could use the swiss army knife to harvest some corn for sustenance, and the hose used to irrigate the corn for water.
I think preventing myself from spiralling into insanity would be the most difficult task, as ten days without human interaction or entertainment would make any sane man go mad. With a mirror, knife, and scrap wood, I would do some carving work – something similar to linocut. I could create a self portrait, using the mirror as a guide, and with light pressure, carve a rough draft into the wood. With ten days at my disposal, I could work on my foundational skills, like human proportions and shading, which are two things I’m not particularly superb at outside of my main medium painting.
And assuming the eating corn plan works out alright, the apple could be cut up to be used as a stamp. If not, I think the core of the corn would be firm enough to be used in a similar way too. And with corn as my only food for ten days, I’ll have plenty of material for stamps. With the variation in size – an apple would allow me to carve more square/ circular shapes, whereas the corn cores would be better for long and thin designs – I think my self-portrait would become a multi-media piece, the stamps being for the background.
By the time the farmers arrive, hopefully I’ll still be alive and have a banging art piece to give them as compensation for eating their corn.",,"Some time last week, while I was skating from my apartment to EQuad, I felt a sudden sense of contentment. It was a perfect weather day – not too sunny that the glare is in your eyes, not too cloudy that the sky is a dull grey – and I managed to squeeze in a break between classes and my one-on-ones. I was listening to Halfway Up by the Brookes and the Bluffs (a song my co-coach recommended), and I realized “wow, this is my life.” With the past year online, I had anxieties about how life on-campus would turn out, and at that very moment, I was so at ease and happy that it felt surreal. I look forward to more days like that, where everything seems to fall into place.",Yes,"Sep 9th, 3:30pm",

My. Friends. I was immediately hooked by these three words a member said in the recruitment video. This to me says that this society is a tight-knit group that enjoys each other's company. I want to experience and learn from such a group that has so much fun as well as drawing out the best in its members. A family that requires effort to build and friendships to last a lifetime. I also want to share with the group I am capable of and would love to contribute to the society's purpose as a member. A special bunch!,"If I were a member of Theta Tau, one event that I would plan would be to have a STEM day with the nearby elementary/secondary school that we have near USC. This would take advantage of the society's community involvement as well as exposing the young minds of America to STEM. I would have the whole group participate with the kids and hold challenges such as the Egg Drop challenge, bridge-building contest, and paper airplane competition. Then, I would bring everybody outside to have a fun day of water balloons fight, slip and slide, and maybe capture the flag if time allows. I would also fundraise to serve everybody lunch - sandwiches (for obvious reasons) - and end the day with ice cream. I feel that this way the society gets to bond with their neighboring kids and each other. ","All of the pillars are important to me as a human being, who is trying to survive college, but the most important would have to be Service. Yes, I would like to party and yes, I would love to get a job. But it wouldn't matter to me if I can't help and give back to my community. Even the simplest tasks or activities can help change the world. I think that the service projects also provide a space for members to improve their professionalism because they are representing a school and a society of high standards. In addition, providing a service can also help members with personal growth and development. I am trying to make the best out of my time here at USC and I feel that Theta Tau could take me there. ","The Office, Silicon Valley, Friends","Chandler, from Friends, would be my most relatable fictional character. He can't help himself with sarcasm and humor. He likes to poke fun at others, but never mean no harm. At the end of the day, he cares for all his friends and would go out of his way to help each and everyone of them. He also gets a lot of money. ","If I were to go to Kansas and were to be stuck in the middle of a cornfield without a single soul in sight with no food and water, I would use all of the items I found at the junkyard to my advantage for survival. First, I would have to put on the snowshoes to preserve my feet. Then, I would build a fire from the wood scraps (gathered some more) and the match. Next, I would stack tree branches into a hut near the fire. After, I would go down to the nearest river or lake to get water and boil it for it to be drinkable. Then, I would snack on my apple because at this point I would be gassed. Afterward, I would go forage for some food with my swiss army knife and lasso. I would cook myself a nice supper with, hopefully, a rabbit and some bird eggs. Then, I would cut a portion of the parachute and hang it on a tree to collect dew for freshwater. The hunting equipment and the soccer ball would be enough to protect me from danger. Tomorrow, I would have to rebuild my fire so I would use the mirror, reflect it through a pouch of water to intensify the heat and shine it on a small pile of wood scraps. Then, I'd rinse and repeat from what I did yesterday until help comes. Also, I would learn to juggle with the soccer ball. ",,To build a lot of relationships/friendships that would last a lifetime.

After the third one, I figured I would come to the speed dating event- and I’m so glad I did. Through rush events, I’ve gotten to see what Theta Tau is like, not just as a professional org but as a community. I’m the first in my family to choose an engineering career, and I think being a part of Theta Tau would give me the opportunity to meet other Viterbi students, as I saw from Professional Night, teach me skills, and show me opportunities that I wouldn’t have known otherwise.","I like the outdoors, so I think it would be fun to do a lake day retreat at Big Bear with the members to bond and relax. Depending on time and funds, the organization could rent out a large cabin for a night. However, if camping isn’t an option, there’s still a lot to do: hiking in the mountains, lake days, smores, stargazing, campfire hang outs and games. I think nice lake day would start by carpooling up to Big Bear in the morning, doing a hike and then heading over to the lake to cool off. For dinner, the club could do a pizza night, where small groups could make their own pizzas- I think it would be fun to see what sort of shapes and things people put on their pizzas- whether you’re a pineapple on pizza person or not- and even make a little game out of it, who has the best pizza (voted by the members). Also, pizza is great because it’s easy to tailor it to dietary needs: vegetarian, lactose, vegan etc. Team building games, like a trivia around the campfire during smores or relay races offer a great way to bring club members together. ","I am the first person in my family to choose a career in STEM, so the pillar I am looking to get the most out of is the professional aspect. If Professional Night taught me anything, it’s taught me that there’s a lot I don’t know when it comes to applying for a job or internship. Just through the rush process, Theta Tau has already helped me: I was able to get some insight in to creating a good resume, how to format it, what I should and shouldn’t necessarily include. All the small nuances that make for a successful application. Other professional aspects of the club: workshops, mentorships, and connections with industry leaders would provide a chance for me to make connections and gain exposure to the field. Beyond outside connections, there’s also a lot I can learn from other members – where I feel like the social and professional aspects of the club come together. Everyone that I have met, both active members and other applicants, has been nice and welcoming, and I get the sense that while Theta Tau members are driven- they all help push each other- and I’d love to be a part of that.","My Neighbor Totoro, ""Crying in Hmart"" by Michelle Zauner, Chef's Table","Fictional character that best represents me is Hermione Granger. Nerdy of me, but I feel that, like Hermione, I have the same sense of ambition and love of learning. There have been multiple times where I wish I had a time turner, because there aren’t enough hours in a day. As the designated ‘mom’ of my friend group, I think the way Hermione is there for her friends is something I relate to. Whenever Ron or Harry needs someone to turn to – she’s always there. In the same way, I try to be there for the people in my life. ","I’m the type of person to take everything, even if I’m not sure I’ll need it, because it’s ‘better to have and not need than to need and not have.’ Before anything else, I need to make sure I have food, shelter, and fire. The first thing I would focus on is shelter: I would take the two pieces of scrap and the parachute to create a tent in the junkyard, because I figure that people will come back to the junkyard, and it’s a more visible spot instead of in the middle of the cornfield. For food, I would eat the apple and then corn from the surrounding field. When I need to get some more corn, I’ll use the lasso to keep track of my path and frequently cut stalks using the knife to mark my path (sorry farmers!). Using the Swiss army knife, I would split the match, so now I have two sources of fire, in case the first fire goes out. I would use the mirror to signal for help, flashing it to get a passing planes attention (lots of farms use planes to spray the fields with pesticides/herbicides) in hopes of getting rescued earlier. If it’s a modern cornfield, it’ll have an irrigation system, so with my mug I would collect water and then boil it over the fire. In terms of keeping myself entertained, I could try to make ethanol from the corn by fermenting it or juggle the soccer ball.",,"Honestly, just being out of the house. I’m looking forward to meeting new people and doing things with friends like going to football games/school events, exploring LA as well as joining the women’s soccer club. Beyond the more social aspect of being at USC, I’m also excited to start FSAE and RPL because it feels like I’m finally making the first steps to becoming an engineer.

Theta Tau is a valuable opportunity for me to build these connections with fellow USC engineers along with representatives from various companies, both of which will strengthen my networking experience. Furthermore, I am looking forward to participating in events of service where I can help provide comprehensive opportunities and play my role in reaching out to others who are also seeking assistance.","Perfection is about optimizing the effectiveness and efficiency of the systems of interest. With the constant inflow of innovation in engineering, there are always ways to improve the systems around us and bring them closer to an optimal level of functioning. In fact, we do not have to look far; there are many ways that USC as a school can be improved, and a lot of these answers lie within engineering. For instance, we could discuss how we could apply engineering concepts to reduce the traffic during daily Trojan Checks in the entrances on campus. I hope to plan a regularly recurring event where engineers from various subfields are able to gather together and discuss flaws we observe in USC’s currently implemented systems, as well as devise plans to tackle these problems through technical operations. This event would perhaps be conducted in a symposium setting. I designed it to serve two important purposes; not only would it provide a valuable opportunity for engineers to collaborate and practice solving problems in the real world, thus strengthening our experience in this profession, but it would also help make USC a better school overall.","I consider Professionalism as the most crucial pillar of Theta Tau since it is the basis of all three pillars. It generates a strong fundamental development for me as an engineer and bolsters my ability to go further and create social connections and contribute services to the ones that have engineering in need. I can exercise various practices and prepare myself before getting into the real world. Being part of Theta Tau not only means that I get to make great connections with other engineers but also signifies that I am part of the connection. As I deepen my expertise in Professionalism, I can be support to other fellow members of the community which will create a stronger social relationship not only bonded by diversion but by trust. Likewise, in order to be able to provide valuable service to others, I myself have to know how to be professional in my own major. Obtaining Professionalism through Theta Tau could help me exploit and spread my experiences and skills to areas that necessitate engineering and give rise to a bigger community of the world of engineers by present others with opportunities to learn Professionalism as well.","One Piece (anime), Momo by Michael Ende, Soul (movie)","I believe Hermione Granger from Harry Potter is a good representation of me. I like being organized, following the schedule I planned ahead. I tend to be meticulous and make sure that everything is under control before I take action. Yet, I enjoy engaging in quality time with the people around me. I am very sympathetic and intuitive, caring about the people that I love. In addition, I am good at recognizing what people desire, and can easily read their feelings, knowing when to be there for them, just like Hermione to Harry and Ron. ","If I were stuck in the middle of a cornfield by myself, I would be primarily worried about water, as the average human can only survive three days without water. I would be ecstatic to have found a mug in the junkyard and would use it to catch any rainwater or morning dew that I can. On the other hand, food would be the least of my worries; I would simply utilize a strike-anywhere match as well as scrap wood to make a fire and cook some fresh corn whenever I get hungry. Moreover, a fire would help me see in the dark and keep me warm at night. One of the most personally difficult obstacles I would face in this situation is such a long period of isolation, To fight against this, I would use a mirror through which I would talk to myself when I am feeling bored or discouraged. In fact, this is actually a habit of mine; from a young age, I have established a sense of independence where I know I can rely on myself for encouragement. Look through the mirror allows me to feel like I am my own best friend, and this companionship is extremely important when I am stranded in the middle of nowhere. Finally, I would use a lasso and twirl it up high to let the farmers know where I am. It would be a useful tool in an area where corns are likely to obstruct the farmers’ sights.",,"Spending my first year of college in Korea, the time zone difference was a significant obstacle that limited my involvement in the virtual community, making it hard to join new clubs and organizations. This year, I want to take full advantage of being on campus and become more involved in the various social and academic opportunities around me, using it as a gateway to meet a more diverse group of people.

I know Theta Tau’s tight-knit community of like-minded peers would provide me with a sense of community and make school seem a little less isolating. Additionally, I wouldn’t consider myself career ready and while advisors are helpful, nothing beats advice from students in my shoes to give me an on-the-field understanding of the process. Lastly, I’ve been looking for avenues to develop and practice my leadership skills and I know Theta Tau has plentiful opportunities to do so and become a better leader. ","I quite strongly believe that STEM-based service learning is an incredibly effective manner to develop engineering skills whilst cultivating sustained interest. I mean, several pedagogical papers cite how framing engineering as using one’s creative and technical skills to help one’s community makes underrepresented students more likely to persist through challenges, commit to finishing STEM projects and pursue an engineering degree. So, if I had to plan an activity for Theta Tau, it would be a STEM service learning project for middle-schoolers. 

More specifically, I envision groups of interested kids from a local middle-school to be paired with a few theta tau members who would guide the students through the whole project. For the project, the students will be asked to visit a local pre-school and interview pre-k children about their dream toy. Then, they will work with theta tau members to engineer such a toy through a series of sessions where they will design, prototype, construct, and deliver the toy. The aim is to impart an understanding of the essence of engineering as a way of helping society and also critical engineering skills such as sketching, using 3D printers/ laser cutters, focus on consumers (think about safety and other consumer-based constraints), and more! ","I would have to say professionalism. Like I mentioned, I feel rather behind professionally relative to other USC students of my age, so Theta Tau’s professional pillar is definitely something I hope to be involved in and gain from during my time with the organization. When talking with current actives, I got a sense of just how helpful Theta Tau was to them professionally – from professional opportunities like internships and co-ops to professional development such as leadership and networking skills. As someone who has been on the internship hunt for a while now to no avail, this is of course an extremely alluring prospect. 

Specifically, I am pretty excited to attend Theta Tau’s tech talks with leading companies and mock interview events to explore my career opportunities, form connection in the industry that would otherwise be rather difficult, and overall just become more career ready by the time I graduate.

More crucially, she harbours an outward appearance of aggressive boldness but is considerably soft on the inside and cares quite a bit about her self-image about not appearing too soft in a way that I can relate. Plus, we're both pretty blunt, fiercely loyal to loved ones and are fun-loving. ","The first thing I’d do is make a survival plan: Food, Water, Shelter, Warmth. First, I’d make a solar water still by digging a hole, placing the mug in the center, add damp things that I foraged for around the mug, a torn part of the parachute over the hole and a small rock on top at the center for condensed water to drip into my container. I’d use the rest of the parachute for a tent by clearing a small area among the corn stalks and placing the parachute above the clearing on the boundary stalks.  I’m surrounded by corn – so I will be fine food-wise (If not, I’d find insects to eat). And for the warmth, I’d dig a deep hole to contain a bonfire, corn husk as fire tinder, corn stalk and twigs as kindling, corn cobs as fuel and the match to start a fire. 

Next, to double as protection from threats (animals or killer dudes) and entertainment, I’d build a maze (and reside with my food, water and shelter in the middle). To do so, I’d build a lawnmower using the lasso, broken mirror (hopefully it doesn’t bring bad luck), soccer ball, the tweezers, snowshoes and spare wood (see drawing). 

On the last day, I’d make popcorn to celebrate my intelligence and resourcefulness and as a token of gratitude to the farmers. Then, I'd write a book, make my maze into a tourist destination, cultivate a cult following, and make bank.

This kind of upliftment has shined through at every recruitment event I’ve been to so far--everyone seems genuinely happy to be a part of the society. Additionally, I really admire how Theta Tau seems to have a collective appreciation for the unique talents and interests of their members, both within and outside STEM subjects. Lastly, I want to join Theta Tau because their incorporation of local outreach provides a great opportunity for students to apply their education toward positive change while still in undergrad.","I think some kind of fun outreach with young children around the USC area and in greater Los Angeles would be a great Social/Service activity. I love the idea of getting kids interested in the hands-on aspects of engineering at an early age. It’s also really important to have people of all professions think through a lens of sustainability, so it would be great if we did some sort of sustainability-design competition day. Kids could model cities, buildings, or any kind of product they choose in a sustainable way. Theta Tau actives could help out during the competition by providing advice, asking questions about how aspects of their designs would function in the real world, and providing them with any tools they need. We could give out first, second, and third place awards based on creativity and practicality, and we could give everyone a participation award from the Theta Tau organization. Wholesome and fun for all!","        While each of these pillars is essential for groups and individuals to make traction in the world, I think that service is one of the most overarching purposes of engineering in general. When I think back to what originally got me excited to major in engineering, a lot of it was this underlying idea of service. Many students I’ve talked to at USC seem to have chosen the field for a similar reason: Engineering allows people to apply their skills and knowledge in a way that can propel our world forward--in a way that can change it for the better. However, as an undergraduate student, it can be easy to feel like you’re not quite cracking into that goal yet. The fact that service is one of Theta Tau’s three main pillars is an indication to me that they are committed to seeing this goal through immediately. This is why I’d say that the Service aspect of the organization is what I hope to get the most out of. I’ve also never participated in a beach cleanup and it’s been on my bucket list for a long time, so I’d be really excited to get to take part in one!

Josh also wasn't afraid to be the butt of a joke, and he would rarely have a chip on his shoulder about it. I hope to always try my best to embody Josh.","Relax, we have corn,' I tell myself, nervously twisting the stem off of my apple. I figure I have to conserve energy so I stay seated but grab my lasso to reel in some shucks (I’m pretty good with the lasso). Since I’ve only got one match, I decide to save my giant, one-woman corn cookout for tomorrow. I eat my apple, tuck myself under my nice warm parachute, and go to sleep in the junkyard.
The next morning I realize I’m really thirsty. I head into the cornfield with my swiss army knife and mug in search of an irrigation hose. I slice open the first one I find and fill up my mug. Hopefully the farmers understand. This hose should keep me going for the next nine days. Breakfast time!! I gather a bunch of corn, so that I have about 30 total… I’m going to have to cook them all at once with my single match. So then I head back to my junk yard, shuck my corn, make the fire, and cook those puppies up.
	At this point, I have all the water I can drink and all the corn I can eat. I’m going to be pretty bored for the next 9 days, so I take my lasso tie it up into one of those soccer ball juggling nets (picture attached) and plop my soccer ball into it. I live out the rest of my days eating gradually less-tasty corn and amateurly juggling until the farmers come.

I’m really excited to get back into some musical and environmental clubs that I was in my freshman year (right before COVID-19 hit) and try out a few new organizations. Being in person at USC provides constant opportunities to participate in really rewarding activities and meet great people along the way. As I’m sure many students can relate to, the past year-and-a-half has given me a sort of re-instilled appreciation and cherishment for my time on campus and what I get to do with it.

I love Computer Science and Game Design and was interested in joining a tight-knit brotherhood community related to my career path. I've worked with service groups before and enjoyed them and the people I got to work with, so I'm looking forward to participating in new events and meeting new people. ","If I could plan an event relating to these principles, I would plan a Profession workshop focusing on interviews. It would revolve around being prepared for the different aspects of an interview: how to dress, preparing answers for common questions, what to ask your interviewer, etc. We would host mock interviews based on each person’s dream company/place to work, to give them an idea of how these interviews would go. It would also cover any potential weak points in their interview process, like not having an answer for a particular question. We could also help students write down points they want to mention, like relevant experience in their resume and applicable knowledge. Overall, an event like this would strengthen student’s performance during upcoming interviews and make them more confident in their abilities. I personally do not have enough experience with interviews and what to expect from them, so having an event like this would be very beneficial to me and other similar students. 
","I mentioned earlier that this is my first semester in person at USC and I don't have many connections here yet, so I hope to get the most out of the Social aspect of Theta Tau. Back before I transferred to USC I went to Citrus College, a local community college in Glendora. I met many different people with similar interests and majors as myself and I really enjoyed working with and getting to know them. My connections with the people around me opened up new perspectives and opportunities I hadn’t even considered and I hope to do the same here. I’ve loved USC since I was a kid and am beyond excited to make new friends that I share my passions and goals with.","Rick and Morty, Black Mirror, Superbad","I like to think of Rocky Balboa from the Rocky series best represents me for multiple reasons. Rocky's life has always been an underdog story, working hard to get what he wants with the odds stacked against him, and I resonated with this. Through vigorous training and willpower, Rocky overcame the odds and went toe to toe with the undefeated heavyweight champion, who he believed he didn't stand a chance against. Relating to this, I didn't have the best life growing up and a lot of things didn't go my way, but to compensate I worked harder to achieve my goals and made it to my dream school! Also like Rocky, I'm Southpaw (left-handed!)","I've got to say this question really surprised me! I was not expecting a survival question haha. I like to think about random survival situations a lot and how I would best utilize the resources around me to survive. The trickiest part of this scenario is finding water, but being in a cornfield would help. To make fire, I would use the pieces of scrap wood and the mirror to light it and cook corn for water and food. I would make a snare trap out of the lasso and wood and put a piece of apple in it to hopefully catch any local wildlife, like squirrels or rabbits. For entertainment, I would play soccer with the soccer ball and a makeshift goal out of corn stalks. In the worst case, I would cut the soccer ball in half to use the halves as bowls for cooking or potentially catch rainwater in. I’m not too sure what I could use the parachute and snowshoes for. They could potentially be used to make net traps for more food, but I would need to be crafty. I could also use the parachute as a makeshift sleeping bag for night. Overall, it would not be the most pleasant experience but I would survive this scenario using these methods.",,"I'm most looking forward to getting involved with new events and experiences at USC! I'm trying to apply to as many clubs, groups, and sports that I'm interested in as I can to make the most out of my time here at USC!

Unlike other organizations on campus, Theta Tau balances all three very important principles: service, professionalism, and social. I want to be part of this supportive organization full of people who I can surround myself to learn from and grow together.","I would plan an interactive STEM event at a local park. We can set up booths with various subjects ranging from safe chemical experiments to coding experience. During this event, anyone in the community will have an opportunity to get to learn and experience STEM. I always thought these events are focused only on young students in schools. While it is important to encourage young students to study STEM by gaining their attention through such events, everyone should have an opportunity to expose themselves to STEM. Hosting events for everyone in the community to have fun together not only motivates the students to develop interest in STEM but also helps adults at any stage of their lives to discover their passion in STEM.","While I believe all three pillars are important, I would choose social if I have to select only one of three. One talented individual alone cannot excel without others who support and inspire them. Engineers always work as a team to propose solutions to address issues in the world. Since it is an essential value, the social aspects are naturally embedded in other service and professional events. I enjoyed Theta Tau’s recruitment events because they provided an introduction to various events at Theta Tau. The Professional Night was a great event to receive feedback and improve my resume in addition to having the opportunity to get to know wonderful people. I would love to get to know more people through Theta Tau.","Lab Girl by Hope Jahren, Dora the Explorer, Harry Potter","Emily from Emily in Paris.
My life always had unexpected turns, and I have been thrown into new environments and situations that I was not prepared for just like how Emily ended up in Paris alone without speaking French.

My family moved to LA about 10 years ago, and everything about moving into this new country was decided right before we moved. Throughout these sudden changes in life, I learned to adapt quickly and get the most out of what I have access to now.","I would first cut the parachute into small pieces and use them to cover the leaves of the corn tree and tighten them with the lasso. I would also start a small fire with the match and wood to keep me warm during the night. Over the night, some water should be collected in the parachutes, so that I can drink from them. For entertainment, I would make a figure that resembles a human using the leftover parachute, soccer ball, and some dead plants. If things do not work out, and it is impossible to survive until the farmers come, I would start a fire using the scrap wood and match then set the cornfield on fire. I will be able to get out of the cornfield and get help when someone notices the fire and comes to put out the fire. Of course before setting the fire, I would clear out the surrounding field with the swiss army knife so that I am not at risk from the fire.",,"I am very excited to be on campus this school year.

Also, I want to meet an array of engineering students while at USC, so I can get exposed to new areas of engineering. Theta Tau’s diverse background of engineering students gives me the opportunity to do just that.","As a child, my mom took me to many science fairs, which set up a foundation for my future in STEM. I have always wanted to participate in a science fair, so I would organize a children’s science fair under the service pillar. The goal of this fair would be to expose the kids to fun fields in STEM, engineering thought processes, and critical areas of STEM in the future. I would set up different stations with hands-on activities pertaining to space, the environment, the human body, and computer science for the children to participate in. Also, I would have one big event for all the campers to view each day, such as a giant elephant toothpaste reaction.","I grew up in the Catholic Church, and through the confirmation process, I grew the most through community service. While getting confirmed, I went through a rough patch with my health; I had many surgeries and was not able to walk for six months.

In Kansas, the yearly average rainfall for a ten-day period is about 0.83 inches, so I will need to collect water from a large area to get enough water. I will set my parachute out on the ground to do this. Next up on my list is food. I will build a fire pit by finding rocks and making a circle out of them. Then, I will use the two pieces of scrap wood, lasso, and mug to suspend the mug over the fire pit. To start a fire, I will find wood and use the single strike match. If the fire gets low, I will use the mirror to direct sunlight onto dried grass. My food source will be corn. I will collect corn and stick it in the mug over the fire to make popcorn. Also, I will save the apple for a special occasion. The other use for the mirror is flashing sunlight into any low flying planes. In the rare occurrence that this happens, I might be spotted early. The knife will come in handy for any form of self-defense. Also, I will find a good piece of wood to carve for entertainment. My other form of entertainment will be the soccer ball.

Balancing my social life, academics, and internship recruitment has been incredibly strenuous and anxiety-inducing. However, the Theta Tau recruitment events have given me pockets of excitement in my otherwise mundane schedule. I have met some amazing people during this process and I hope to become fully involved in this brotherhood. I would love the opportunity to join a network of people who share my passions and have each other's backs no matter what. ","If I could plan one event for Theta Tau, it would be an event centered around food. A cook-off would be an incredibly fun way to fire up our competitive spirits and show off our creativity. However, this could be logistically difficult to organize so I would opt for a potluck- a less messy and more efficient event as we would not have to worry about finding the resources to accommodate that many chefs. Furthermore, without time constraints and the pressure to compete, we could see a much more diverse set of dishes. Even those who do not know how to cook, like myself, could learn something new on their own time and present their results. Food is often used as an expression of cultural identity. Just as Theta Tau has incredible diversity amongst their members, so would the dishes presented. When all is said and done, this would be an amazing opportunity for members to bond and eat some great amazing food.","The most important pillar of Theta Tau for me is the social pillar. While professionalism and service are incredibly important, my desire to join Theta Tau stems from the unbreakable bonds and support system between its members. I always strive to surround myself with people I can learn from and grow with and I know I can find this at Theta Tau. Furthermore, I believe that the social pillar intersects significantly with the other two. Regardless of the event, the social pillar is always present. During mock interviews, networking events, or volunteer opportunities, we are always forming and strengthening our relationships with one another. With Theta Tau, I hope to find a family that I can do anything with. Whether it’s study groups, retreats, or parties, I know that this is the place for me.","Space Jam, Impractical Jokers, A Series of Unfortunate Events","Four years ago, I dressed up as Big Bird for Halloween. While the costume was a joke at the time, after a bit of research I do believe we are somewhat similar. Although we don’t resemble each other physically (besides relative height) we share many of the same traits. Big Bird is known for enjoying being included in activities, being curious about the world, and valuing his friends. Barring his inability to read and write, Big Bird and I share a surprising amount of similarities.","The first thing I would do is construct a shelter to shield myself from the glaring sun and potentially freezing nights. I would use the parachute as a temporary home with the material from the snowshoes as insulation. Then, I would set up a fire using the match, scrap wood, and corn husks from the field. At this point I just need enough food and water to survive. I would milk the corn with the swiss army knife and allow myself a singular slice of apple per day as a treat. In terms of entertainment, I would try to kick the soccer ball a reasonable distance away and try to retrieve it with the lasso. It would be a similar concept as fetch except the lasso element makes it more similar to a trickshot. Lastly, I would use the tweezers and mirror to pluck any lip hair that grows during my wait because I can not pull off facial hair and I would like to make a good first impression with the farmers.",,"I am most looking forward to getting involved on campus and discovering new interests. During our year of online classes, it was nearly impossible to meet people, get engaged in clubs, and decide where to dedicate our time.

I want friendships that are long lasting, study-buddies, and people who understand what Viterbi is like. I spent time abroad using my degree to give back to communities and Theta Tao could be an opportunity to continue that within LA and with friends. ","If I could design any event for Theta Tau it would be a social event. It would include a bracket tournament of Super Smash Bros. Everyone one would be allowed to compete so it could be very inclusive. There could be multiple rounds so everyone gets to learn. We could have food, drinks and all get together at the house. It's an opportunity for a hobby (just like spikeball has become) to emerge within the community. We could even elect a winner at the end. ","I think I hope to get the most out of a mix between professional and social. I think having friends to study with (wether they be in my classes or not) is helpful. To be around people who care so much about their academic careers is inspiring. I want people to bounce ideas off of, work on senior design projects with, and practice interviews. I think having friends who value service, professionalism and social aspects of their lives are good people to have around. I want to be immersed in a culture of engineering, diversity, and most importantly one that includes both men and women. Women are a minority in engineering and it's hard to find friends that you can bond with over classes that share your gender.","Big Bang Theory, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, Selling Sunset","I think the fictional character that best represents me is Monica from Friends. I always wanted to be Rachel growing up and to feel like I had all the money and clothes in the world but as I got older I realized that isn't what matters. I have good friends and family who support me just like she had the gang and her brother. She was a chef, but she was really good at it. She worked har at her job and even supported her husband for a while with her career. I work hard at engineering and am always trying to do my best. I do have a need for things to be a bit perfect just like she does, but I like to think that is to my benefit. It makes me take better notes, or study harder. She also cares so much about those around her. She would do anything for them. I have friends and sisters who I would do anything for and whom I love. Monica is caring, hardworking, and loyal and I feel I embody all of those traits as well. ","I would say first of all water is the most important. I could squeeze water out of the corn to survive, or build an apparatus. I would suggest use the Swiss army knife to cut the parachute to the right size. Use the lightest color on the parachute. Place it in a bubble like form over the mug. place a small pebble on top of the parachute to weigh the center down like a funnel. Collect water! Now I need food. I can eat the apple and corn (but I can also survive 10 days without food, I'd just be unhappy). Next, use the wood and mirror and match to create a fire. I can also undo the lasso rope and burn it for kindling. After it is burning, keep it alie with corn husks. Then, for entertainment I'd learn how to do a rainbow with a soccer ball, or reevaluate mu beauty skincare routine by checking myself out in the mirror. I could also build my own corn maze. Or learn to snowshoe on the mud. ",,This school year I am most looking forward to the community I want to build within Viterbi. I want to make friends who I can study with and spend free time with.

Going to all these events and seeing the smiles on everyone’s face, I love how everyone is so comfortable with each other. Throughout all parts of my life, having someone older to help direct me has made everything easier both in school and volleyball. Most of my closest friends are these people who became mentors in my life. Not only does Theta Tau offer many resources for me, I feel like it offers a community that feels so much like home and hopefully I’ll be able to join. ","One event that I could plan for Theta Tau would be mainly in service and social. I think you guys mentioned how some events include beach clean ups. I love how service in Theta Tau isn’t just being involved with engineering but helping the community as a whole. Back in SF,  I worked at St. Anthony’s foundation which served the homeless. LA has one of highest percentages of homelessness and although there’s nothing huge we can do, I believe we can start small acts of giving. We can work with the USC Homeless Initiative to set up a day where we not only learn about homelessness but also what we can do. I’d specifically like to do this during the fall and winter. I’d start with creating a slideshow about homelessness in LA and working with Homeful.LA to educate others. Then, I’d like to create Back to School Drive and Christmas where we give out school supplies or clothing items to those in need of them. I’d think it’d be fun to go shopping together as a community and also have the opportunity to see the children’s faces when they receive simple gifts. ","Service is the most important pillar to me. Growing up, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to go to a private school. Everywhere around me, I had resources which simply made life easier. I felt like I was living in this damn near perfect bubble when I never educated myself about the problems outside my bubble. As I grew older, I learned more about homelessness in SF and working at St. Anthony’s Foundation, I realized how much power small acts of service hold. It’s as easy as sitting down and having a talk with someone. One conversation can go a long way and sometimes people just want someone to listen to them. A way of saying thank you, from my opinion, is giving to those communities who have provided these opportunities for me. After leaving my volleyball club and the Janet Pomeroy Center, I went back to work during my free time. As a community, it’s important to broaden our horizons by educating and helping each other understand the needs of society. I never really combined STEM with service and I’m looking forward to trying new things and I think the smiles from peoples’ faces is what’s gonna get me. I’ve volunteered with kids with disabilities and it’s amazing how much I learn from watching them live their lives to the fullest without allowing their disabilities to get in the way.

She’s a strong-headed, obsessive overachiever, and fierce girl who grew up tackling the social scene in NY. People see Blair as the party girl but when Blair has a goal, she’ll cross whatever line to get to her goal and never gives up. She knows what she wants and she’ll go for it. I relate to her in that way. She’s extremely protective of her community and NOTHING is more important to me than my family. Blair has a reputation to uphold but never allows herself to lose herself in the process and I have much respect for her.","My main source of water would be dew and condensation from the leaves of cornstalks, as well as the small amount of water included in each cob of corn. Hopefully it rains, so the rainwater could be another source of water. To keep myself from starving, I would rely heavily on the ears of corn since there’s no other choice. I would supplement each day’s meals with a slice of apple to stimulate my taste buds and collect water with my mug and parachute. I would use the soccer ball to keep myself in shape with the parachute as my net. I’d also stick the leftover scraps of wood (if not used for a fire) onto the ground and tie the lasso to the ball to make tetherball for entertainment (probably wouldn’t work). If I got especially desperate for entertainment, I could sing country songs to myself while honing my lasso skills on random ears of corn. For a source of heat, I would set a fire during the day using the mirror and sun on the pieces of scrap wood -- saving the match for an emergency -- and hope each night that not too much of the cornfield around me burns down as I sleep. If anything, I’d use the snowshoes to make tracks in the dirt and if a bear sees it, it’ll get scared because it thinks there is a larger creature out there. Then, it’ll walk backward confused and hopefully trips on the mug I strategically placed and falls while the rope of the tetherball game traps the bear. The bear will be either used as food or a friend (I hope). :)",,"I am extremely looking forward to branching out and meeting new people.

Despite having a great group of friends, I always wished I knew people that could relate to my goals. Coming to Viterbi I hoped to join an engineering community where I could relate academically and professionally, but also learn from others' experiences. That is exactly what Theta Tau is, a family that constantly pushes each other to be their best selves and achieve their dreams. I can think of no better way than to pursue my goals than as a member of Theta Tau. ","As vice-chair of the Gilroy Youth Commission, I organized/hosted the Pampered Princess Party, an event for girls in Gilroy. Some of my fondest memories are from this event, being able to give back to the community with my friends. Using the principles of service and brotherhood I want to plan an event that unites members through a common cause.

Soap-making, before you knock it, hear me out. Imagine a calm post-covid evening where members of Theta Tau are gathered at the Theta Tau house. Different essential oils, colors, herbs/seeds, and molds are laid out for everyone to engineer their ideal bar of soap. An evening of chatter, snacks, and music to destress from all that is Viterbi. Plus it gives us a chance to do something artsy for a change. After the creative evening of bonding, the soaps can be donated to local shelters. For example, the Los Angeles Youth Network would distribute the supplies through groups homes, and youth shelters specifically targeting homeless and runaway kids ages 11 through 17. This event allows members to bond, while still giving back to the community which makes the experience even more special.","Pre-covid I would have probably said professionalism, a large part of the reason I chose Viterbi was because of the Trojan Network and multitude of career opportunities. While that is still extremely important to me, now I would have to say Brotherhood. Of the many lessons, months of quarantine have taught me, I learned that having a community to lean on is essential for my growth. Getting support and encouragement from people with similar passions has never been more important. Being a member of Theta Tau will give me the lifelong connections and friendships to turn to when I need mentorship, support, or just to have a good time. Becoming a member will also give me a chance to do the same for others in the future.

Attending the various recruitment events this week I could see that Theta Tau is a family, who’s there for each other inside and outside of school. A community that wants the best for each other and that is the kind of energy I want in my life. The brotherhood aspect of Theta Tau will provide me with a way to make USC my new home, instead of a temporary tab on my browser.","Brooklyn 99, Frozen, The Happiness Advantage (Shawn Anchor)","“Not just clean, Senna clean” my roommates coined.

My brutal honesty and determination to do everything to perfection sometimes land me in hot water, but I always mean well. Like Monica, my ambition to pursue my goals is unwavering whether that be at card games, school, or life. ","Wow, now that my lifelong dream of being stranded in Kansas has come true, I can do all the exciting things I dreamed about. After my long nap I’d be pretty hungry, so before I get to work I would eat the apple and some corn. Soon after I would start planning my adventure. With the items in the junkyard I would try to make a hot air balloon and fly around. Using the swiss army knife I would collect corn stalks and begin weaving them into a large basket with handles. The weaving made me really dehydrated so I set off to find water. Luckily, the farming irrigation system provided water so I was able to rehydrate. I fill the mug with extra water and head back to the junkyard. I attach the parachute to the basket using the lasso rope. Now that I have the general form of the hot air balloon, I need to make it fly. Using the swiss army knife I cut the soccer ball in half to hold my burner. Since hot air rises, the air inside the balloon will cause it to rise upwards. I would collect some kindling from the field, break apart the scrap wood, and add some to the soccer basket. Using the leftover lasso rope, I would tie the soccer basket under the parachute. With the match, I’d light the burner basket and travel around the cornfields and enjoy the starry Kansas nights.  
",,"Apart from meeting new people and finally getting the full USC experience, I am really excited to learn this semester. I never thought I’d say that, but it was really hard to become passionate about classes over a screen and I really missed enjoying what I was studying. After a whole year of zoom school, I am excited to be able to delve into my classes and really get something out of them. Just two weeks into school and I am completely in love with most of my classes (not CSCI 104) and can’t wait to see how the rest of the semester goes. ",Yes,"September 9th, 2:30pm",She/her

While theoretical concepts like physics and calculus are helpful, it is the social aspects of engineering and student life that I value the most. Discussing creative ideas and even hanging out with such a diverse and well-rounded community of engineers is an amazing experience. Theta Tau is the perfect blend of professional development, community service, and social fun. Balancing these three aspects is something I not only have experience in but am also looking forward to continuing in the engineering field.","I would plan a social event that incorporates aspects of the other two pillars. Specifically, a day-long trip to a local beach. Members could spend a couple hours cleaning the beach as a service to the community. This includes picking up litter, properly disposing of waste, and recruiting other guests at the beach to participate in the cleanup. Theta Tau could take it a step further by directly working with the Heal the Bay Organization and utilizing their Marine Debris Tracker app to document progress. This is a great way to provide service to the local community while also contributing to global conservation efforts and marine research. Theta Tau’s hard work would be rewarded with a beach day filled with swimming, barbecuing, and volleyball. When it becomes dark outside, Theta Tau could set up a bonfire. This would provide a comfortable setting for mock interviews, free from the stress of a normal interview. This beach bonfire time could also be used for roasting marshmallows and jam sessions between musicians within Theta Tau. The end result of this event is a fun-filled social outing that also implements community service through the beach cleanup as well as professionalism with the bonfire interviews.","The pillar of Professionalism is the most important to me. As a sophomore in engineering, there is still much I have to learn about career opportunities. Being in a supportive professional setting like Theta Tau would be an incredible way to learn from the best minds at Viterbi. I value the experience of upperclassmen students and appreciate it when they pass down their knowledge to the next generation of incoming students. The resume review night is a prime example of how helpful Theta Tau is towards their members and is something I was glad to be a part of. I also admire the various professional events Theta Tau hosts. I would love the opportunity to discuss research with professors at faculty dinners, hone my interview skills on mock interview night, and network with industry representatives at tech talks. Through the various Theta Tau recruitment events, I learned how loyal alumni are and how they often return to support active members in their professional pursuits. I, in turn, would like to give back to future students in the same way. Overall, Theta Tau offers an extremely supportive and active professional resource and fosters the same social professionalism I am looking for.","Dolphin Tale, Big Hero 6, Lemonade Mouth","I am best represented by Malcolm from Malcolm in the Middle. It is a common trope for dedicated students to be reserved. Malcolm defies this stereotype as he takes school seriously but is also socially outgoing. Malcolm also makes time for athletics as he plays high school basketball and balances his activities with his job at Lucky Aide. Likewise, I take pride in my academics but also cherish the value of friends and social activities. I also have experience balancing academics and a social life as I played varsity baseball and worked as a tech counselor at a summer camp.","My first priority is to create a shelter. I would use the swiss army knife to cut a large portion of the parachute and use the two pieces of scrap wood as dowels by sticking them both into the ground vertically. I would drape the piece of parachute over the two dowels and secure both ends using the lasso as a rope. In case I get splinters, I could use the tweezers to remove them. I would then cut the soccer ball in half to form two bowls. Since I know the Kansas area well, I know the state gets decent rainfall and would use the leftover parachute material to create a rain trap that directs precipitation into the two bowls. I could also use each snowshoe as a filter to keep large particulate matter from entering my water source. The mug would be used to drink the collected water. I would eat my apple as a food source but could also consume the corn from the surrounding corn field. Since my objective is to be found as soon as possible, I would use the match to light a smoke signal fire using the corn stalks as kindling. I would also use the mirror to signal planes flying overhead. To keep myself entertained, I could watch the clouds while also being on the lookout for planes to signal. In the event that I cannot signal help before the farmers arrive, I can survive using my shelter, food, and water source.",,"After the disappointment of being isolated and online freshman year, I am most looking forward to doing everything (classes, clubs, gatherings) in person. Walking around on campus and seeing everyone bustling around Trousdale, eating in the Parkside dining commons, and studying in Leavey Library has made me happier than I ever expected. Although it’s only been two weeks, I’ve already discovered how strangely satisfying it feels to stress over an in-person quiz.

Theta Tau is an amazing organization of determined, smart, fun people that I feel I could make a home. I love that Theta Tau has three pillars of social, profession and service. I can make friends while furthering myself as a programmer and helping strengthen the community. I would love to grow with the people in this club and together become leaders of the tech industry","Based on past personal experiences that I have found rewarding, I would love to plan a Service Night with a goal of helping high school students who cannot afford SAT/ACT tutoring and may need general help in the college preparatory process. In addition to giving a general overview of a good preparatory plan for standardized testing, we could also help explain how to navigate the other aspects of the application process, such as filling out the common application forms, receiving waivers to apply to different schools at a lower cost, applying for financial aid, and finding and applying to scholarships. I would envision this event to have a general information lecture for about 30 minutes about these topics. Then we could break up into small groups (one leader for every 3-4 kids) to answer questions in a more personalized setting and give any other recommendations/advice. If possible, it would also be great to create some form of recurring future communication with the students where we could answer any questions they may have in the future, such as creating a chat with each small group on Groupme. Receiving and giving college preparatory advice has had an amazing impact on my own life and I think accessing Theta Tau’s collective resources to provide similar services to members of the Los Angeles community would be greatly rewarding. ","I am hoping to get the most out of the Professionalism in this club. USC provides so many resources for academic success between events, clubs, speakers, different centers etc, that it is hard to know where to spend my time. Through Theta Tau I could learn where to best use my time, as well as get advice from older members who have experienced all of the hardships I have had at USC and have wisdom to pass down. I could also find people who are currently in my classes (which I already have) and find more people to study with and exchange knowledge. I was able to experience this in profesional night at Theta Tau where we looked over resumes together. I learned so much while having a really great time interacting with and meeting other students. My resume got a makeover so I can better apply to internships and jobs while I met people from my classes and had an overall great time. That is what made me very excited about Theta Tau and hopeful for the opportunity to attend more events such as those. ","How I Met Your Mother, Queen's Gambit, A Wrinkle in Time ","I feel very strongly that I am a combination of Ross Geller and Phoebe Buffet. I am academic like Ross and can talk about nerdy science things. I value education, and am very passionate about the jobs I have. At the same time I relate a lot to Phoebe. I am funny, aloof, and in my own world sometimes. I do things in different ways and like to relax and have a fun time with friends. ","The basics of survival are food, water and shelter. Since at max I will only need to survive for 10 days before help comes I don't need to focus on food and can easily survive 10 days without it. In Kansas the temperature is warm so we don't need to worry about staying warm. As a shelter I would use the parachute as well as nearby trees and the rope from the lasso to build a tent for me to live in. This tarp would be waterproof and keep me safe and dry. For water I would use the mirror as a knife to cut the ball in half to form two bowls. With that I could catch rainwater or other precipitation. To clean the water I would boil it with the mug as a fire proof cup to boil the water in to make it safe. I would start the fire with the scrap wood and by rubbing sticks together to make heat. I would save the strike-anywhere match to use if there was someone above and wanted to signal to them. To signal I would light the snowshoe on fire and throw it in the air. The first day when I had a lot of energy I would build the shelter and look for firewood. As I become more fatigued I would only need to start a fire from the firewood I have already collected (and stored dry in my shelter) and boil the water that I have already collected.

In Theta Tau, some of the guiding principles include culture of brotherhood, lifelong relationships, and mutual respect. These are principles that I really appreciate when building a relationship with people and friendship. People who I can rely on and build  a strong form of brotherhood with, that’s the main reason I want to join Theta Tau.","I would plan an event on Profession and Social. The event I shall plan would seek to emphasise the essence of the engineering profession, stating all the achievements we as engineers have made; our prowess, physical infrastructure, advancement in technology, issues we have addressed and upcoming goals we intend to meet. I shall try to invite past engineers who have left their marks both in the college and in the outside world, proving the importance of our profession.
I shall focus too on the principle of being social. The importance of sociability cannot be overstated. New ideas, technology and advancements cannot be made if they are not shared. If someone has a problem or has reached a roadblock in this engineering research, sharing the problem amongst a group of people, people who have mutual interests built on a brotherhood that is Theta Tau, might as well have the problem solved. That’s why I shall focus mostly on the Social pillar.","The pillar amongst the three pillars of Theta Tau that I aim to take the most out of is the Social pillar. Networking, and mutual interests built  on a strong brotherhood means a lot to me. That’s what I am definite I shall receive, partake and pass on too in the Theta Tau brotherhood. I want to be able to relate with the people in the Theta Tau family that will impact knowledge I had not fore had. I want to be able to have people I can fall back to when I need certain aspects to be clarified to me and vice versa. The Social pillar is the most I will benefit from because as a person I understand the essence of Service and Profession but Social means a lot to me.","Rich Dad, Poor Dad - books, Grey's Anatomy - Tv show, Fast and Furious - movie ","The fictional character that best represents me is Huey Freeman from the 2005 Adult Swim animated TV series, The Boondocks.

He also has an admiration for black historical figures. These are qualities that the fictional character Huey represents in me as a person.","In my quest for survival and entertainment, I would first search for a semi-comfortable junk car in the junkyard that would serve as my accommodation for the next 10 days. My next plan would be how to gather ripe corn from the corn field that would serve as my main source of food. I would find or make a makeshift container as a clean pot to  the corn should there be water or roast the maize. 
The dry stalks from the corn can serve as wood to light a fire in the cold night. The Swiss knife will be what I’ll use to cut down the aforementioned stalks. In the daytime, the mirror, as a reflective material, would come in handy to light a fire which I’ll manage till evening and into the night. 
Should there be rainfall, the mug would be used to store water and be taken in little rations to keep me hydrated. The apple will be cuddled into thinner slices and be put in the mug of water, first as a sweetener and also to preserve the apple slices to be eaten later. The parachute made from nylon would serve as a blanket and a makeshift sleeping bag at night. The lasso would also come in handy to tie the parachute around the car as a makeshift rain cover on rainy days. As for the soccer ball, that would be my primary source of entertainment. After a satisfying meal and a slice of apple and water, I would entertain myself by playing with the soccer ball and survive in anticipation for the next ten days.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MiwSRa8ric9RXBddipGNXM-nPDO9GGPJ,"What I’m looking forward to this year is meeting people and networking.

The members of the social fraternities were only business majors, only cared about partying, and didn’t understand the engineering struggle. I believe that joining Theta Tau will allow me to reintegrate into the social scene with a community of members who understand what it means to be an engineering major, the hard work that it requires, and knows how to have fun outside the classroom. Additionally, Theta Tau will give me access to internships and service opportunities, which are instrumental to a successful engineering career.","Given the three principles of Service, Profession, and Social, my event would be a conglomeration of all three principles called STEMchella. Similar to the way that Coachella is a weekend all about music and having fun, STEMchella would be a weekend “festival” that celebrates the three principles of Theta Tau and has smaller micro events that do so. My event would be a three day one in the San Francisco area, beginning on Friday and ending on a Sunday. Friday would be a day dedicated to the Service pillar of Theta Tau. Teams of students from USC or other Theta Tau chapters around that area (Berkeley) could raise money for lack of STEM infrastructure at local public schools or volunteer to teach kids basic engineering concepts. Saturday would be dedicated to the Profession pillar of Theta Tau. I would organize site visits to tech conglomerates in the Silicon Valley area and workshops to enhance the professional aptitude of Theta Tau members. Finally, Sunday would be all about the Social pillar of Theta Tau. Social gatherings, parties, and lunches/dinners would be put on to allow members to interact with members of other chapters in the San Francisco area.","       The most important pillar of Theta Tau is Professionalism, in my opinion. This is because I believe Professionalism is integral to all of our future careers and it shapes a favorable identity of a Theta Tau member.
       One of the main reasons that I am vying to join Theta Tau is due to the professional opportunities that this organization presents. Not only is there access to alumni that can give opportunities for internships, but who can also give relevant life and academic advice for the areas of study that I am pursuing. In the social fraternities that I rushed in the first few weeks of school, there was no sense of professionalism and more emphasis seemed to be placed on partying. I would even argue that professionalism is a prerequisite to the other two pillars of Service and Social. Forming professional connections with individuals worth your time allows you to provide community service to those who really need it and spend quality social time with those who will only boost you up and not bring you down. Because Theta Tau members put their professional interests up front, they appear more headstrong, confident, and intelligent than the wider University community in terms of professional acumen.
"," Never Have I Ever, 3 Idiots, Breaking Bad","The fictional character that best represents me is Phineas Flynn from the TV show Phineas and Ferb. I would contend that he best represents me because of his nerdy nature and knack for creativity. Being that the majority of Theta Tau members are engineers, one could contend that we all are a bit nerdy, but I would say that I’m extra nerdy. As my friends would say, I’m always studying, looking for ways to boost my resume, and the person to come for when help is needed with any subject. While Phineas is creative in creating all the inventions that he and Ferb make, I’m more creative in trying to design new technology and tools to give back to organizations that have given to me such as the National Speech and Debate Association and Children’s Cancer Fund.","Operating under the assumption that I have enough food and water for the next two days, since the prompt says that I am nearly out, I would keep myself entertained by playing around with the soccer ball and sleeping for the majority of the time. Once these first two days are up, it is a brute survival scenario. Basic human needs consist of food, water, and shelter. Since I have to survive for about 8 more days, these needs must be met for me to make it through. To satisfy my need for food, I can eat the apple for one day and pick corn from the cornfield for sustenance for the other days until the farmers arrive. To cook this food, I would start a fire using the match, the pieces of scrap wood, and the snowshoes cut up by the swiss army knife as fuel. If the fire ever needed to be relit, I could use refraction of sunlight on the mirror to gain another flame. In regards to the human need for water, I would find a water source near the corn field and filter the water using a piece of the parachute to hopefully clean any toxins. Finally, for shelter, I would use the rest of the parachute tied down by the lasso to some of the corn stalks to create a shady area to sleep and eat. In my free time, I would play more soccer and learn my way around the cornfield, attempting to solve the maze that it is.

Theta Tau would also keep service a central part of my USC experience. ","I would plan a three day dive retreat. When diving, you’re placing your life in the hands of those around you, and the kind of trust that experience builds carries far beyond the day of the dive. We could utilize the trojan network and work with local dive shops to obtain gear and make pricing feasible. For those who have never gone scuba diving, certification could be included in the trip. In the weeks before the trip, non-certified members could do the PADI elearning course, and the confined water dives. Certification could be completed while diving with already-certified members in the first two days of the trip.  On the third day, we could host a lionfish hunting competition. Lionfish are an invasive species that cause devastating damage to coral reefs, and coastal communities are constantly battling to keep them in check. Lionfish hunting is one of the only effective strategies to keep the lionfish population low.  As a wrap up, we could host a bonfire and celebrate with a roasting of the fish we caught that day. Lionfish is nearly as delicious as the feeling of knowing you’ve actively contributed to protecting one of the world's most important ecosystems.","I am excited to be a part of an organization that takes contributing to society so seriously, and I know that the professional opportunities offered by Theta Tau will be invaluable. However, I believe I will get the most out of the social aspect of Theta Tau. It hasn’t been achievements or possessions or even any adventures that have most enriched my life, it has been human connection. I’ve had the most meaningful and treasured experiences doing seemingly mundane things: doing dishes with my Dad, lugging gear with coworkers, doing problem sets with friends and striking up conversations with strangers while waiting in a line. At USC, it can be easy for me to lose sight of that joy. Too often I’ll get so drawn into an assignment or a project that everything else will fade away. I think being a member of Theta Tau will help me balance and integrate my academics with my social life. Also, in a very real sense, service and professionalism are social activities at heart. And, in the end, it was getting to know the Theta Tau actives that made me sure Theta Tau was absolutely something I wanted to be a part of.

","First, I would take a moment to be grateful for where I am. The corn will provide everything I need. Corn is the most irrigated crop in Kansas, with more than a million irrigated acres. I would start by finding the source of water for the irrigation system. This is where I would set up my tent, using pipes taken from the outer edge of the irrigation system as poles and part of the parachute as cover. With the rest of the parachute, I would fashion two hammocks, one to store water, and one for contemplating what poor life decisions led me to being cornantined. I would hang the hammocks using rope from the lasso, spliced at both ends. I would hang the mirror to create a flashing, rotating signal. Then I could sit in the shade, eat my apple, and braid the stalks of corn to make a mat and blanket to sleep with. Next, naptime, because naps fix everything. I would also disable the sprinkler nozzles around my camp so I could stay dry. Depending on conditions, I could use my single match to start a fire, but even if that were to go out, nearly every part of corn is edible uncooked, at every stage of growth. For entertainment, I would make corn dolls for an elaborate drama. Each night, I would sing myself to sleep using a ukulele fashioned out of the wood board, a piece of piping, and the strings of the snowshoe.

I see this as more of a professional event, where younger students could ask questions about classes, research, internships, and future job prospects. Throughout my time at USC I have been constantly reminded of how great of a resource upperclassmen students are. After all, they have gone through it all, and they may know some life-hacks the younger students have not quite figured out yet. Furthermore, this would give upperclassmen a chance to talk about their work and experience. Something I have found that is a bit odd in engineering is that people are almost too humble...they never talk about their accomplishments or all of the cool work they have done! I also think this would be a good opportunity to unite members and form tighter bonds between different classes of Theta Tau. After the questions section, it could turn more into a social event where everyone just hangs out and reflects on the good and bad times of being an engineer :). ","I think all three pillars are important, however the one that is most important to me is social. As a sophomore who got stuck with online classes my freshman year, I feel that I do not have many strong friendships within engineering, and as we know, engineering can be hard! One of my biggest motivations for applying Theta Tau is definitely the support group it provides. I have friends who are current members, and they have told me that the community is incredible, one of them even said that they feel that they always have a home away from home within Theta Tau :). Another reason this is important to me is because I have never had friends with the same engineering interests as me. I am from a somewhat rural town in Washington and most of my peers from high school did not go to college, of those that did almost no one went to study STEM. Due to this, I feel that I am sometimes at a disadvantage because I did not grow up with engineering support all around me (looking at you Bay area kids :) ).

First I would utilize my crocheting skills to help build a shelter out of cornstalk with the lasso and tweezers. I imagine this would take a few days to fully complete. I would then use the mirror and dried out cornstalk to make nightly fires (saving the match and scrap wood for emergencies). I would use the mug as a cooking utensil, mainly to help boil water and whatever other edible substances I might find... I would then use the parachute and soccer ball for entertainment. I am not sure if there is a strong wind in Kansas, but maybe I will be able to use it to glide around the cornfields :) and as for the soccer ball, maybe I can play a quick game with a tree (if Kansas has trees lol). The apple I would explicitly save for day 5, the halfway point! Now if I survive that long, I think it is worthy of celebrating so only then can the apple be consumed. The swiss army knife would primarily be used to assist in all the above activities and maybe help hunt for food if it really comes down to that. Now a quick google search tells me that 200 miles takes roughly 3 days to walk, so if I decide to just walk instead that's when the snowshoes would come in handy. Those snowshoes were meant for walking. ",,"I am most looking forward to meeting people! I have already talked about that a lot throughout this application, but I am most excited to meet like-minded people through my clubs and classes! Society always says that  ""college is the best years of your life"" and I am truly excited to just be on campus and hopefully experience that! I am also excited to keep doing the research I got involved with last semester. Due to COVID, all of my work was online, and I am excited to be with the Professors and fellow student researchers in person. ",Yes,"September 8th, 10:30-11:00",She/her/hers

As fun as drinking every night of the week sounds… I decided against joining a frat and searching for something meaningful to myself. Theta Tau doesn’t just provide social aspects but it also focuses on the future of its members with the professional pillar. I’m intrigued by the idea that I could create lasting bonds with so many amazing people while preparing for my future and serving the community around me. There’s nothing more special than spending time with a group of best friends with similar interests and aspirations as me.,"Throughout high school, I was required to volunteer for many of the organizations I was a part of. I would always elect to spend my hours volunteering at Respite Care which is ultimately a day camp for kids with disabilities such as down syndrome or autism. Most volunteer opportunities felt like a chore to me. Respite Care, however, never felt like a chore but more of a hobby because I enjoyed my time facilitating and participating in activities with many eager kids who strived to have a normal life with normal activities. Nothing gave me more joy than watching the kids laugh and play with each other.

With that in mind, I would plan an event under the service pillar of Theta Tau where we would reach out to Best Buddies USC to plan a day where we go to the regional center with them. Best Buddies plans holiday parties, dances, etc… for the differently-abled members in the regional center. We would help them plan one of those events and attend the event. Partnering with Best Buddies would expand the name of Theta Tau further while giving members a different volunteering opportunity than what they might be used to. 
","Before college, I've obtained experience in both service with volunteering and social through meeting friends. With that in mind, I'm looking to get the most out of the professionalism pillar. Personally, I'm terrified of the ""real world"" with finding jobs and making a living for myself. With Theta Tau's Professionalism pillar, I have upperclassmen with experience of obtaining internships and going through interviews to help me in the process. Along with that experience from upperclassmen, the events Theta Tau has are extremely beneficial. Mock interviews would give me a baseline evaluation of my interviewing skills and advice to improve upon those skills. As someone who knows very little about what I want to do with computer science, the tech talks Theta Tau has would be great ways to determine specific jobs that I would be interested in. It's overwhelming trying to choose what I want to do with the rest of my life but with the help of the Professionalism pillar, some of that stress would be relieved. The professional aspect of Theta Tau is actively helping me create a future for myself and going through the process with a whole class of brothers/ sisters motivates me to become a part of Theta Tau.","The original Pokemon series, The Office and Ted Lasso","As someone who would absolutely sing “I Want It That Way” with a group of suspects, Jake Peralta from Brooklyn 99 embodies a couple of my characteristics. Not only can Jake make a comedic situation at any given moment, he’s also one of the best detectives in the precinct. Similar to Jake, I enjoy being social but when I’m faced with challenges in school or other clubs, I’m able to put my head down and work through those challenges. Matching Jake’s ego,  I have a competitive edge that builds up my ego in events such as soccer or pong.      ","In order to stay alive, I would live off of the corn in the cornfield for food and water. For water, I’d have to use the army knife to cut the kernels off of the ear of corn and collect them in the mug. I would grind the kernels with the handle of a snowshoe and since the ear of corn was just recently cut off the plant, there should still be a small amount of water inside the kernels. 

Now that the boring survival stuff is out of the way, I would take the two scrap pieces of wood and stake them into the ground and tie the lasso at the top of each piece connecting the two pieces. This would create a soccer goal in which I would channel my inner Messi and play soccer for hours on end (I’ve played soccer my whole life so I wouldn’t get bored). 

When I need a break from soccer, I’d use the snowshoes to draw in the dirt and create mini crop circles in various openings of the cornfield. I’d shatter the mirror and put single shards in the middle of each crop circle. When the farmers come back I would construct this whole story about being abducted and ending up in the middle of the cornfield. Of course the farmers wouldn’t believe me until they found the various crop circles completing the glorious prank I spent the last ten days planning.

In conclusion, yeah, it would be light work.
",,"For the past couple years, I felt like my life was at a standstill with online classes and the same scenery I had in high school. Coming into campus for the first time gave me a real sense of direction and felt like my life was kicking off again. I’m eager to meet new people and become involved with the multitude of activities usc has to offer.

I really want to meet a lot of fellow students interested in engineering and get to know them personally. Connecting to people involved in my industry is very important to me, so I can further my computer science career. Our community is badly in need of help regarding the many crises it faces, including homelessness and poverty. Finally, we all need to relax sometimes.  ","I would plan a service event in which we go around campus and provide various badly- needed services to the homeless population in Los Angeles. This would include making sure everyone has enough to eat, is clothed, and is able to find some form of shelter. A major problem in our society is that people form bubbles in which they only interact within the bubble and forget that there are people around them badly in need of help. People really need to get outside of their safe space and see the world as it is: a tough place that takes no prisoners. Mental health services, healthcare in general, food, clothing, running water, electricity, a roof over the head, and the list goes on are things we often take for granted. These are things that anyone needs for basic survival, yet many in our surrounding communities do not have them. Additionally, many of these people simply do not have anyone to talk to, as they are isolated due to societal neglect. Talking to people, getting to know both them and their perspectives on life and the world is very important, especially in a university of such immense wealth like USC. ","This is a very difficult question to answer, because all three things are very important to me. In the long run, however, I would have to admit that the most important thing to me is Professionalism and the friends/connections I make. I chose these things because I only have 1.5 years left in the university; these things are what will last a lifetime, well beyond my time here at USC. While I’m in the professional world, I’m going to need to know other people I can work with, investors for my company if I create one, people working in various companies if I want to get a job somewhere, and people I can have a good time with on a weekend. In addition to getting various career-related opportunities, I want to get to know people that will always be there for me in tough times, and I can be there for when they’re struggling in life. Humans are fundamentally social creatures and making sure that we all have good company when we need it is essential to our mental, physical, and emotional health. ","The Big Short, Air Crash Investigation, and iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide","Mark Baum in the Big Short is a pretty good representation of me in general. I'm very busy and stressed out, but I also spend a lot of time out with my friends. Although we work in different industries, both of us have a good understanding of how the world works and are very involved with our professions. We both have a desire to make certain that what we are doing now is being done correctly. Finally, we both have a strong moral compass. We feel angry that the world around us is both unjust and corrupt, sometimes causing us to reach a state of complete and total disbelief. ","Thankfully, I’m in a cornfield, since there most likely will be corn growing somewhere that I can pick. My priority would be ensuring that I have a reliable food source while I’m stranded since my food supplies are beginning to run out. This means picking and cleaning the corn, as it is most reliable food source assuming I cannot find any other edible plants or animals. To Make the corn edible, I would use the match to light the wood. Then I would boil the corn in the mug, and before doing this I would try to find a lake, river, or stream. Additionally, I would boil plain water on the side to clean it of contaminants for drinking. For emergencies in which I cannot get food for any reason, I would keep the apple and small amount of food/water I already came with. 
With regards to my spare time, I would try to see if my horse is nearby anywhere, since most likely it would have left tracks of where it went. Also, since there’s a junkyard, I would assume that there are cars or parts of cars. Luckily, I have quite a bit of knowledge about how cars work. During my spare time, I would attempt to get one of the cars running and see if it would be able to start. If necessary, I would look at other cars for any spare parts of fluids that they contain if something is missing in the best-shape car.

Theta Tau’s professional resources will prepare me to utilize my USC degree to its full potential and help me get a successful future career. I also would love to experience new volunteer opportunities through Theta Tau and give back to the community.,"The one event I would plan for Theta Tau would be a beach clean-up. USC is in a prime location by the coast with beaches very close by. People litter at these beaches all the time and are ruining the natural beauty for both tourists and locals. This event would focus on the service pillar of Theta Tau with the organization helping clean up the surrounding community for the benefit of all people in the local area. This event would also be a nice way to socialize with other club members as people walk around the beach and talk to each other while they are pickup up garbage from the sand. After the time spent on the clean-up, club members can have a fun and relaxing beach day. People could play volleyball, go for a swim, and enjoy the beautiful view of the beach.","The aspect of the organization that I hope to get the most out of is the professionalism pillar. The professional event that I went to where I got my resume reviewed gave me priceless advice from Christian, a student who was once in my shoes. He taught me how to properly format my resume and which information I could potentially add to it. The LinkedIn presentation that Ash presented after was also very informative because I am a transfer who was not part of freshman academy, so I do not much prior experience with LinkedIn. This small event effectively showcased all the way that Theta Tau can help me succeed professionally. I will be able to learn from my peers and upperclassman to improve different aspects that will maximize my chances of having a great career coming out of USC. I will be able to network by making friends through the club and attending other professional events that the organization hosts.","Rocky, Sherlock Holmes, Forrest Gump",The fictional character that best represents me is Samwise Gamgee from the Lord of the Rings.

I am a very determined person and I work my hardest to complete the task at home. I also enjoy helping my friends and I am always there whenever they need a hand.,"Surviving this situation would be easy because I am surrounded by a cornfield. I could eat the corn around me every day for every meal for 10 straight days until I am rescued by farmers. The cornfields would have needed a consistent source of water to grow the plants so there would likely be a river or some type of irrigation system nearby for me to drink water from so I do not die from dehydration. I would split the apple into 10 parts with the swiss army knife and eat one part every day as a special treat. To keep myself entertained, I would make a goal using the two pieces of scrap wood as posts and then practicing scoring different types of soccer shots using the soccer ball. I would also learn how to use the lasso for fun and attempt to lasso the easier, bigger objects. I would spend a lot of time sleeping on the ground with the parachute used as a blanket and under me, along with the cornfield around me for shade. I would also use the swiss army knife and snowshoes to make crop circles in the cornfield. These crop circles will help the farmers find me easier in the big cornfields and give me a fun and interesting story to tell.",,"I am looking forward to making up for the experience that I missed out on because my freshman year was completely online.

Other reasons are the friendships, professional development and participation in oldest and largest professional engineering fraternity.  ","Professional development is a focus for me.  Although the idea is not original, I would love put together a visit to at one of the more intriguing engineering/tech companies like Neuralink, SpaceX, Andruil, or a more esoteric start up like Spring Labs, Cloud Imperium or Dave. The goal would be an event where members can get exposure to cutting edge companies renowned for excellence in engineering and tech. Because of the strong entrepreneurial emphasis that exists at USC visiting these relatively young companies would provide three distinct benefits: exposure to cutting edge tech companies, exposure to firms that hire new grads, and exposure to start-ups. My experience with fund raising for non-profits has helped me develop my persuasion skills. I would relentlessly reach out to the powers at these companies until I find a willing participant.  Then it is just a matter of seeing what is made available and organizing a visit. Ideally we would hear from a top executive and a top engineer and get a tour of the engineering departments.","I have always been invested in volunteering and community service. I love the opportunity to be a part of a brotherhood that can forge lifelong bonds. But, it is the professional pillar that is most important to me. I want to raise my understanding of industries, companies, jobs, and internships. I also actively seek opportunities for professional development. Whether it is enhancing my leadership, collaboration, communication, interview,  technical skills, or problem solving skills. All are areas I hope to evolve always.  Something I find great value in is the chance to listen or interact with successful leaders, engineers, and scientists, be it a casual conversation or a formal lecture. Without fail I come away from these interactions with some new information and insights. Industry info sessions and company tours are both activities I try and pursue regularly. My goal and aspirations will be better achieved with strong professional development along with a commitment to service and a diverse network of like-minded people.","Brave New World, South Park, Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy","The character that represents me is Bilbo Baggins with a bit of Tony Stark DNA aka Bony Bark.

But, the characteristic Bilbo posses that I try to live by is his great sense of humor and ability to laugh at himself. 

  
The Tony Stark comparison may be wishful thinking. But who wouldn’t want to identify with a self-effacing genius philanthropist billionaire.","The most important survival skills would be fire, shelter (warmth) water and food. 

Farmers would only come to tend some time between the last frost date and harvest.  There is nothing to tend in the winter. The last harvest dates in Kansas are early May. So it is not winter. 

First, I would build a lean-to using the parachute and sticks or limbs and the lasso for lashing. I can use the scrap wood if it is big enough. 

Then I would collect firewood. I would build a fire pit in a safe protected spot.  I would have to keep the fire going always because I only have one match.  Gathering firewood will be a constant activity. 

Even if I don’t eat for 10 days I will survive. If there is corn I can eat raw corn. But if not I already have some food and water and an apple. Finding water will be very important.  If there is rain water I can collect it using a piece of the parachute off the top of my lean-to into the mug and any puddles. Absent of rain water I can use a piece of non-essential clothing to to soak it up and squeeze dew on plants into the mug. If there is any snow on the ground I can gather that. If I am really desperate I can drink urine.

I would organize an event with Theta Tau members where we simply pitch ideas in a Shark Tank fashion. It could be a business of some sort that has nothing to do with engineering or the next big social networking site. There could be food and beverage at this event and no set end time, so we don’t need to always be looking at the clock or rush anything. This idea takes inspiration from old Facebook and Apple idea sessions where the early employees would simply spitball ideas and see what sticks. I feel like it would be an event that could help foster the creative spirit as well as the social bonding between all Theta Tau members. There is no grade or reward necessarily, just something that each member could think about and continue outside the club if they so choose. This touches the professional aspect by possibly creating a new business idea with partners and also touches the social aspect by allowing for interactions between club members. I believe this event would be especially appealing to an engineering, collaborative mindset.","I hope to get the most out of the professional and social aspect of the club, personally. I am planning on joining outside volunteer cubs for service, and although I would not be against service in Theta Tau, it is not the emphasis of what I am looking for personally. I really want something social because I am a sophomore and spent all of last year online and I really want a group of friends that I can have fun with and depend on for various things. It is hard to find a group like that in college but I think Theta Tau would fulfill that role in my life and I think I could bring a lot socially to the club as well. As for the professional aspect, I also want to take advantage of the connections and networking opportunities that Theta Tau could offer or help me get in the first place.

I am lucky I am in a cornfield as even though it isn’t very appealing, I have essentially an unlimited supply of food in corn. Therefore, with my food and water settled on the first day, I am able to think about other things. I save the single strike-anywhere match tucked away for an emergency and instead collect sticks in the environment to start fires with. I learned how to start a fire this way in boy scouts, so with some time I could get a decent fire going. This fire would be on each night to keep me warm and also keep possible predators away. I use my swiss army knife to cut these sticks into the proper shape and I also carve sticks into weapons for possible hunting if I see an animal. I could cook the animal using the fire that I have built.

Being a first-generation low-income (FGLI), I believe that peer support and guidance was instrumental to getting me where I am today. Through Theta Tau, I feel that I will be able to find my community of engineering siblings as well as the resources to grow as a student and a professional, as well as to have fun and build valuable friendships throughout my college years. ","Looking at the Service page, it seems like the majority of the educational focus has been on younger, elementary and middle school students. I would love to see Theta Tau to also partner with a local high school (or maybe multiple) and provide some college-readiness workshops. Although I think this would work better as a semester-long program where members mentor a high-schooler one-on-one, we could still make an impact with a single day event. Small groups of members could lead resume-building, financial aid information, career, and mock interview workshops and/or others depending on interest. There would be a morning and afternoon session to allow students a chance to attend at least 2 workshops of interest, separated by a lunch break. The lunch break would give the students to get to know each other as well as the Theta Tau members participating in the event, highlighting the social pillar of the fraternity. Since studies show that it’s important for the students’ to have relatable role models, this type of event, as opposed to STEM-focused ones, allow us to reach out not just as some tech experts but as people who faced the same difficulties not too long ago.
","I think the Social pillar is the most important to me because it’s the one the other two flow out of. The bond of friedship between Theta Tau members are valuable connections that will remain beyond your college years. It is because of these bonds that members are able to truly help each other grow in professionalism and service, by demonstrating good character and valuing growth in themselves and others. During the pandemic, I realized how much of a class and school experience relied on those simple interactions, discussing a difficult concept in class or hearing about an opportunity from a friend in the hallways. Being an engineering fraternity, members of Theta Tau can relate to the difficulty of schoolwork, see familiar faces in class and get guidance from older members. I personally am really interested in the Big/Little events because I really love and learning from older peers and their life experiences. Also, being from New York, I’d love to get to know the West coast better and meet Theta Tau members from other chapters along the coast. Most importantly, college isn’t just to study but to also have fun and I love that Theta Tau offers a community of students that are dedicated to not only their studies and careers but to also forging friendships through events and retreats.
","The Fire Next Time, Midnight Gospel, Spirited Away","I find Toph from Avatar: The Last Airbender to be a good representation of me. Firstly, I’m really short. I’m an only child of a single mother so I’m very independent and direct. I like to joke around and I’m not very openly affectionate but my family and friends are extremely important to me. I believe that you can do most things if you truly set your mind to it, but I also don’t dwell on the past. If something doesn’t go as planned, I look for ways to improve to be ready for a similar situation in the future.

My first step into surviving this Kansas wasteland involves building an innovative above-ground shelter. Being 5 foot, I absolutely do not stand a chance among the tall stalks of corn so I'm going to use those handy-dandy scraps of wood to help hoist myself up onto a parachute shelter which I will drape over the cornstalks. I’ll be sure to remember the most important thing for survival: fire, which I will attempt to create using the angle of the mirror in the grueling Kansas sun. Now, you’re probably thinking, why not just use the match? Worry not, it will come to use on the last day. If there is a stream somewhere nearby, I will pop the soccer ball with the knife and use it as a sack for carrying water and weave a net for fishing out of the lasso. I will also braid the cornstalks to make a rope to build myself a friendly companion. Once my friend (please refer to photo), Corn-a-tron 3000, is complete I will spend my days talking to him and reflecting on how I even got in Kansas in the first place. By the 10th day, I’ll be sick of waiting and want the farmers to get me first thing in the morning. That is when say goodbye to my dear Corn-a-tron 3000, and proceed to make the ultimate sacrifice, by lighting the match and setting him on fire so that the farmers can notice the smoke and promptly retrieve me.

The reason this is so exciting to me is that I chose to go into computer science because I learned about the innovations in natural language processing and its potential in assisting those with disabilities.

As a first-generation freshman, I have had almost no guidance with college topics. Theta Tau allows me to seek this guidance through older members and the resources that Theta Tau provides. While in Theta Tau, I want to be able to make long lasting friends that have the same interests as me while also contributing as much as I can to Theta Tau. I’m also excited for the opportunity to attend professional events and the fun activities Theta Tau has in store for us.","	The event I would plan would be a professional but social event. Employers would be invited to observe and mingle with possible candidates for their professions. In this event, there would be competitions of majors so that employers can see how students use the skills they have learned for different tasks. The purpose of these competitions would be so that students can have fun and chill out before they introduce themselves to the employers. Different fun activities can set up a fun, stress-free environment for students so they can do so without too much worry. At some point, employers can be set up with a group of students and perform challenges together so that they lose their intimidating nature. At the end of the competitions, there can be a grand prize for the best group just to make it fun and exciting. Then there would be a time where employers and students can chat over coffee and build connections with each other. At this event, to satisfy Theta Tau’s service nature, we can have a Viterbi bake sale for college students. The money we raise can go to an organization for research, scholarships, or for a good cause like feeding the hungry.","The pillar I am hoping to engage in the most would be service. As a second generation Hispanic immigrant, I have faced poverty firsthand and have seen it around me from close family and friends. Despite the difficulty of the events I have experienced because of this, I believe that they have made me a stronger, more humble, and empathetic person. I will always remember what it is like to be helpless in a horrible situation and take the lessons I have learned to help others in similar situations. To start helping people, during the COVID pandemic, I helped my church distribute food and resources to Latino families who were in desperate need. I was able to provide a resource they could fall back on that my family didn't have. I was glad to be able to help these families get back on their feet during my service. It has made me want to continue  participating in community service during my studies. One thing I regret was not participating in more community service activities while still in high school. While in Theta Tau, I would like to participate in this pillar as much as I can so I can assist people in need.","Gentleman Jack, Wonder Woman, Mulan","As a Disney princess fanatic, I feel as though Princess Tiana best represents me. Princess Tiana is a strong woman with dreams she strives to fulfill. From nothing, she has worked hard to achieve her dream of opening a restaurant. I feel as though I am the same. As long as I can remember, I have dreamed of going to a good college so that I could step out of generational poverty and become the success story my parents came to America for. I have worked hard to achieve great things and, just like Princess Tiana, my dream came true.","First, since I am stuck in a cornfield, I will gather enough corn that will last me 10 days. I would have to apologize for stealing later but it's a dire situation, they would understand. Then, I cut down a bunch of corn plant stems with my army knife to make a small hut (along with the wooden planks), which I would tie with the lasso rope to secure it. I would drape the parachute over the hut to create some shade against the sun in case it gets hot. The mug would be used to collect rainwater if it did rain so that I could have something to drink, as unsafe as rainwater is. Now that I have food and shelter, I can relax for a bit and collect my thoughts. Eating will have to be kept to a minimum to preserve resources. On a good day, I’ll eat the entire apple throughout the day, just so I don't get bored of the corn. If it gets cold at night, I can gather rocks and corn plant stems to create a fire. I can also gather plant leaves to make a leaf blanket. When I am bored, I can practice on my soccer skills and juggle the ball between my feet. That way I wont get rusty on my soccer skills while I am stranded. Just so I have something else to do, I can also use my army knife to mold plant stems into random objects, like a mini knife. ",,"Since it's my first year here, I am excited to make new, long lasting friends. When I was younger, it was very hard for me to branch out and make friends, especially because I had so much on my plate. It was very scary to meet new people. Overtime, I have improved my communication skills to the point where I can talk to many people and not feel overwhelmed.

For instance, since this is a professional fraternity maybe someone could help me improve my time management skills so I don't wait until the last minute to fill out an application (which may or may not have happened with this application). Joining Theta Tau would overall be great for my development as a person.","If I could plan one event I would plan breadlines which relates mostly to service. Breadlines is an event I participated in a lot through one of my high school clubs. Essentially we would hand out free food, clothes, toiletries, and other necessities to those who needed it in downtown Providence. This may be a bit ambitious for several reasons but I still think it would be a great event. There are plenty of people in LA who could use a free meal or a new pair of socks and if we have the means to give it to them we should. Planing and fundraising for this event wouldn't be easy but it would certainly be worth it. ",I think all of the three pillars are extremely important and go hand in hand but the one that I think may be most important is Professionalism. I think gaining experience in the professional world will be very valuable for my future. It sounds like there are plenty of opportunities to learn from people who are very knowledgable in their respective field. The networking opportunities seem incredible and I would hope to really take advantage of that. I hope to utilize all the tools that would be at my disposal in order to become the best professional and person I can be. ,"Psych, fantastic Mr. Fox, Surf's up","The one that stands out to me is Cameron Frye from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

I don't, however, think of myself as a backup character or somebody's sidekick nor do I think that's what Cameron is. I think he is a great friend and someone who is dependable and I hope others see in me what I see in Cameron.","Honestly, my initial though was to practice soccer and try to learn how to use the lasso to pass the time. However, I don't think that would be a good idea because I would be exerting too much energy. I think I would have to focus mostly on surviving rather that entertaining myself. With that said I think I would use the parachute for shade and just chill most of the day. I would simply day dream and let my mind wander. I could also use the parachute as a blanket when I go to sleep. Also I could gather twigs and branches and start a fire if it got very cold. Who knows maybe I would go full Tom Hanks and create my own Wilson with the soccer ball. Would this be a fun 10 days? No it certainly would not but I think that's my best chance of survival. Is this the most creative answer you've ever heard? Also no but it's practical and that's the type of person I am. I think saving my energy, staying in place and just entertaining myself with my imagination is my best option. Walking 200 miles in under 10 days is probably doable but if I'm low on food I don't think it would be such a good idea.",,Honestly I am a huge basketball fan so I am really looking forward to watching games in person at the Galen Center.

Although it was only an introduction, I was awed by the endless possibilities of a good idea combined with some elbow grease, and the broad field of engineering in general. Engineering is truly the key for conveying your thoughts/ideas into reality and via Theta Tau, I hope to further my exploration in this field by surrounding myself with like-minded individuals and building connections that will last a lifetime. On the other hand, I hope I also get the chance to contribute with my own experiences and insight.","While there are free engineering camps/events for many youth in the community, those events are neither well advertised or show the real world applications of engineering. Rather, they focus on more of the technical and introductory applications of engineering fields. 

I propose an event that focuses on more of the real life applications of engineering to not only show the youth about the technicalities of engineering, but also get them excited about what they could do with their knowledge. This event would not be limited to only one engineering discipline. Members of Theta Tau could show and teach kids about their fields by helping them create something with their knowledge. This could look like a computer science student helping kids build an app, a mechanical engineering student helping kids build a model car, etc.

By hosting this event, all three pillars of Theta Tau could be met. Service would be met because members serve the community by teaching kids. Profession could be met because members are also learning more about their respective fields by taking on the teaching role. Social could be met because members are working together to build the curriculum for their respective fields. ","I was the person who avoided contact down halls until high school when friends from student government invited me to take part in a school event. Although initially reluctant, I participated because I’d grown tired of being secluded. 

Instead of being ostracized, I was welcomed warmly. Inspired by the people who showed me this kindness, I wanted to become that open hand for others. I introduced my introverted friends to this new world. They refused. Dismayed, I remembered actions speak louder than words. 

When class positions opened. I quickly took advantage, getting elected vice president. My job was to increase spirit, but I personally had the goal of getting as many introverts involved as possible.

I organized icebreakers where I paired reserved and outspoken students and gave them positions of authority because I knew that most introverts just need support to shine. My strategy worked. Through example, my friends who initially refused, became outgoing, starting their own organizations, and becoming examples for others. 

In this sense, Social is my most important pillar. I wouldn’t be who I am today without guidance and I strive to be that helping hand for others by fostering camaraderie in every community I’m in.","The Lion King, Game of Thrones, Toy Story","Like Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty, I can find enjoyment in one day trying to find the meaning of life, while another day trying to go on the most bizarre and spontaneous adventures to have fun. I also like to believe I am introspective and inquisitive just as Rick Sanchez seeks to find his inner character and morals, so aside from his egotistical and self-destructive characteristics, I believe that Rick Sanchez best represents me. ","I’m not going to lie and say I’m some crazy engineer that can create a computer out of those items, a sculptor that can create an art piece, or a creative genius that can make anything out of anything. Instead, I will focus on the second part of the prompt which is how I will keep myself entertained. 

What keeps people entertained? Why, a game of course! With the materials at hand, I will invent a new sport. Of course, since I am by myself it will have to be a sport you can play by yourself. The game will go something like this...I will first use the swiss army knife to carve the two pieces of scrap wood into two poles. I will then use the lasso to tie the two wood pieces into a net or goal of some sort. I will then tie the parachute between two trees to make a makeshift catapult. The goal of the game is to use the catapult to shoot the soccer ball into the net. The point is to get as many goals made as possible out of 10 shots. One important rule though is that it can only be played when the sun is out (for reasons that will be obvious in the next sentence)

What will this BRAND NEW game be called? It will be called….Bask-it ball!

I also am extremely interested in developing my professional skills through resources like mock interviews and faculty dinners. These resources provided by Theta Tau are absolutely invaluable. Finally, I am extremely passionate about STEM education and would love to take part in related service projects. ","As part of the social pillar, I would plan a paper airplane contest amongst randomly selected teams of 3-4 people. While some members may be more familiar with aerodynamics in general and paper airplanes in particular, everybody loves a good engineering challenge. Paper airplanes are also cheap, recyclable, and easy to clean up after. However, in order to elevate this event, I would add a scavenger hunt at the beginning so teams have the opportunity to collect materials that could upgrade their airplane. These could include stiffer color paper or rubber bands and propellers. The scavenger hunt could take place across campus or be limited to one engineering building/quad. Prizes could include t-shirts or gift cards and free food would be provided. ","While each of the pillars is important to me, I would say service is the most so. There are many social and professional opportunities available through the Viterbi School of Engineering and USC in general, but the service events coordinated by Theta Tau are not nearly replicated anywhere else. Being part of a group of passionate engineers invested in STEM education is an extremely valuable experience that I would love to take part in. One of my favorite aspects of my high school robotics team was the demonstrations and workshops we put on for younger students, and I hope to continue that while in college. ","Cake Boss, Derry Girls, Documentary Now!","I believe that Sister Michael from Derry Girls wonderfully represents my no-nonsense attitude and creative approach to problem solving. Sister Michael is admirably forthright and significantly funnier than me, and possesses judo skills I can only aspire to, but her humor and dedication to pursuing her own interests no matter what are two things I can relate to. Lastly, she is always seeking out new knowledge in a wide variety of fields. ","My first priority is water. I spread out the parachute, staking it on the snowshoes and (for now) one piece of wood to collect morning dew and any rainwater that comes down. Then I search for an irrigation system for the corn, as this will supply a high volume of fresh water that I can poach. This carries the added bonus that farmers may notice a problem with the irrigation system and come find me early.  I snack on the apple. My next priority is food. As no time of year is specified, I assume it is mid summer, early in the harvest season. I will be eating a lot of corn. I am not nervous to use my single strike anywhere match because if my first fire goes out, I can start a second one by focusing sunlight through the mirror onto dead corn leaves. I splinter my pieces of would into varying sizes and ration them throughout my ten days. Because I assume my horse was with me before I woke up, I also will likely have several pounds of horse manure that can be burned once it dries. I slice corn kernels off the cob and put them in the mug, where I add collected water then hold it over the fire to boil. For shelter, I hide under the parachute during the heat of day, but I'm not concerned about low temperatures at night. I teach myself some sick soccer moves to stay entertained.

Its been so great to meet people outside of stiff Zoom socials, and I am really looking forward to continuing with the study groups I am in.

In this event, brave volunteers would present a proposal for a low-time-commitment, creative engineering project to the rest of Theta Tau. After the presentations, all the members would vote to create a small set of ideas to actually work on. Teams would be made to implement each idea. Members would be assigned to each team if their skillsets matched well with the team.

At the end of the semester, each team would present the fruits of their labor to the rest of Theta Tau. The members would rank the projects (except the one they worked on) to decide the best project.
","If I were to rank the pillars, I would put the social pillar first. I'm hoping to meet people who have similar personality traits and interests as me. I think that school is stressful and time-consuming so it's important to have times where you can get with other people and joke about classes and talk about life outside of academics.

Humans are social animals and engineering demands that you spend a lot of time in your own head, so I think it's great to have a place for engineers to get together and relax.

When I went to rush events, actives would cheer on their fellow actives, ask if they wanted to grab food together the next day, and joke with each other, cracking smiles. My biggest takeaway from the events is that Theta Tau is truly a loving community. Knowing this, what engineer wouldn’t love to be a part of Theta Tau? It’s a great contrast to the cold numbers and mechanics we constantly deal with in courses.","I would plan a cultural food night! Actives would be divided into teams to create foods of different cultures; for example, teams could be divided to create doenjang jjigae (Korean soybean paste soup), paella, tikka masala, etc. These foods could also be from the home country or ethnicity of actives so that there could be a guide. After teams are done making their assigned foods, there would be a big potluck for everyone to enjoy the food. Maybe there could also be a competition for who made the best dish.
	Although this event is primarily aimed to be a fun, social one, I want to also gear this event to be geared towards social education. What’s a better way of learning, embracing different cultures than enjoying their delicious foods? There is also the opportunity to teach actives of eating or drinking culture for their respective dish. Perhaps one team is making tikka masala with jasmine rice then members could be encouraged to try the food with their hands as it is done by natives. To be completely honest, I’m not very educated on this topic, but I know it would be fun to learn more and cook with fellow actives!
","Social is the most important pillar to me. To preface, during my year in the pandemic, I had dropped out of the University of Washington due to financial restrictions and enrolled in my local community college. During this time, I also worked part-time at my mother’s pharmacy and also helped my father with his recovery from COVID-19. With how hectic and dangerous everything was the past year, I rarely had time to keep in touch with friends or to foster and maintain new ones. With almost everything behind me now, I want to start fresh at USC. I want to make lifelong friends, go on 2 am taco runs together after getting smashed on soju, struggle to put up tents during retreats, hype each other up when we get job/internship offers. I want to make permanent memories within the short two years of college I have left. This isn’t to say that I can achieve my goal solely through social events. The knowledge we share when teaching communities in need holds permanence within the people we assist, and the mutual struggle in attaining my first job/internship will forever be remembered.","Futurama, Calvin and Hobbes, One Piece","	Hobbes from Calvin and Hobbes best represents me for his calm, introspective nature as well as his wild personality when with Calvin.

However, like how Hobbes shows affection through his erratic energy, I love to go wild and let out my energy with close friends.","Given that I’m in a middle of a cornfield, I would have an almost unlimited supply of corn and its leaves and stalks. For food, I would be eating roasted corn all day. I would conserve the match solely for emergencies as it is my only guaranteed fire source. I would spend time trying to create a fire with the mirror, focusing sunbeams on a piece of scrap wood as well as some corn leaves and stalks. In the case that this doesn’t work, I would use my match and try to conserve the fire as long as possible with piles of corn leaves and stalks. I would also be roasting corn in advance during this time to stockpiling as much food as possible for the coming days.
        For water, I would try to get as much water from the stalks as possible. I would cut the top layer of the stalk with the swiss knife to expose its insides. Assuming the snowshoes are of the traditional type that looks like tennis rackets, I would use the “handle” side to squish the stalk along the inside of the mug and force water out.
        The corn and soccer ball would probably be my main sources of entertainment. I always wanted to learn how to dribble and juggle a soccer ball: I have plenty of time to do it now. Juggling corn also sounds like another fun way to take my mind off the struggle.",,"I’m looking forward to meeting new people, talking to them face to face, hanging out: I’m looking forward to all the social interaction, connectivity I was unable to have due to the pandemic.

It would take me 50 hours to get to the closest civilization. If I allocated 10 hours a day, I would reach the closest civilization in 5 days. Luckily, since I'm in a cornfield, I have plenty of food around me, and I'd have days left to spare. BUT THAT'S A BACKUP.

Everytime I get tired, I would use the tweezers and the mirror to obliterate the hair in between my eyebrows as an Indian male. If Black Beauty didn't return, I would put on the snowshoes (for style purposes), and collect a ton of dry corn around me that I would later use for fodder in a parachute contraption. I would cut open the soccer ball to make a bumper to protect my gluteus maximus upon take off. I would use the single strike anywhere match to light a large fire that I continue to tend to during my first 5 days and use leftover sticks to later light the parachute contraption. I would use the largest cornstalk to help launch me up in the air using the lasso to tie me to the base at the beginning with a parachute attached to my back. I would use the cornstalks under my snowshoes to propel me further into the air when I lit them on fire when taking off, which is used as an attention getter as well as a propeller. If my feet got too hot, I'd simply kick off the shoes. I'd use the mug and the mirror in the air to reflect light and try to get far away attention and making clinking noises to see if anyone heard me.

Some of the strongest bonds ever formed are those in which you entrust someone with your life like troops in the same platoon. While I don’t want to go to literal war because I value my life; for my event, I’d like to mimic something like war. I propose we go to Hollywood Sports Paintball & Airsoft Park and play a game called “Protect the President.” In Protect the President, there is one team that is smaller than the other team, in which one president is selected. It’s the whole team’s objective to protect the president and make sure the president stays alive. The other team has to work together to kill the president. If anyone is shot they have to go back to their base, and then they are allowed to return back into the game. After paintball, we would have a big lunch where we could meme on each other and compare bruises over a sunset ","I feel like I am the luckiest person on the planet. I get to study what I love and attend a higher education institution for free. I live with my best friends and eat just about anything I am feeling at a given moment. Given that I am so fortunate to have a leisurely, fulfilling life it only feels right to help others feel the same joy I feel everyday. I very much believe in karma and think the world would be a better place if everyone employed the golden rule. I hope to get the most out of the service pillar as I feel like I am eternally in debt for all the good fortune I have. In addition I feel like I don't get as many opportunities to volunteer like I used to in high school and it would be nice to repay some debt for being the luckiest person on the planet.

My senior quote was, “ I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.” Also, I have zero short term memory, forcing me to live in the moment.","I would first gather a lot of sticks found around the area and make a bonfire with the strike-anywhere match. I would collect all the ash from the bonfire and place it in the empty mug and add equal parts of water and mix it with the tweezers. I would then take the metal tweezers and break them in half. I would use a coarse rock to sharpen and shape the broken tweezers into a needle. I would use the swiss army knife to cut the ends off the parachute, so that I could use the strings. I would use the strings as rope to tie the broken tweezers shaped to be a needle onto a straight stick. Then I would use the swiss army knife to shave the hair off my body, and then I’d sterilize my needle tied to a stick by placing it in the bonfire. Finally, I’d dip the sterilized needle into my mug, which is full of ink, and use it to give myself stick and poke tattoos on my freshly shaved body. This way, when I get rescued and tell the story to my friends, I’d have gnarly tattoos to prove it all. I’d eat the crops around me to keep me alive until I get found.

As a passionate engineer and creator, I see Theta Tau as the best place for me to find a community like this, where I can grow my professional career, bond with new friends, and give back. I really look forward to becoming extremely close with a diverse group of like-minded individuals and putting together activities and events, having lots of fun while learning and growing along the way. ","An event I believe would be a fun bonding experience for the organization is a clothing upcycling workshop. Members can bring old pieces of clothing or scraps of fabric and can work together to turn their old clothes into something brand new and useful. This can involve cutting and stitching together different pieces of cloth, painting new designs, dyeing fabric, or taking apart clothes to make something new altogether. We could potentially work with nearby organizations to source old clothes to use as materials. A fun addition could be to end the event with a fashion show or presentation where everyone can show off their creations or do a mock auction to give away the new products to other members.

An upcycling workshop would be a great social experience as members can work together on their projects and learn from others who may have upcycled before or have experience sewing or painting. This event also includes a service component as the organization can learn a way to stay environmentally responsible. I’m excited to see what a group of talented engineers can come up with given a bunch of old clothes, tools, and a vision.","Theta Tau’s dedication to service and giving back to the community resonates with me. The world of engineering and technology has provided me a home and a sense of belonging, and I love being able to introduce this world to other students who potentially might also find a home there. From volunteering to teach students with no programming experience how to build mobile apps, to running an entrepreneurship organization for students to pursue their innovative ideas, working to support budding creators has been a defining aspect of my life. I strongly believe the most important part of undertaking the difficult journey to creating change is finding people who will support you to take on the many challenges it poses. Reading about how Theta Tau has provided this support to children in disadvantaged communities to help them discover their passions in engineering inspires me, and I truly hope I can contribute to this service and help guide the next generation of engineers and innovators. Service is the most important of the three pillars to me, and I look forward to collaborating with my class to create new ways to change the world around us, within engineering and beyond.","1. Brooklyn Nine-Nine  2. Phineas and Ferb  3. Drums, Girls, and Dangerous Pie","One of my favorite TV characters of all time, and one I feel represents me well, is Mike Ross from Suits. Mike Ross is an associate working for Harvey Specter, the greatest lawyer in New York. The way Mike applies himself to his mission to impact lives through the law parallels my dedication to using technology to create social impact. Mike is also deeply caring, always putting his friends and clients before himself. And much like my style, Mike isn’t above some fun, using his quick-witted humor and affinity for movie references as he overcomes challenges and opposition. ","My first move is to use my extensive travel experience to recall some useful facts about Kansas. I know this time of year is when corn is harvested, meaning I am standing inside of a near unlimited food supply. Most of the farmland in Kansas is also sprinkler-irrigated, meaning I have access to water. So, the best strategy would be to hunker down, build some shelter, and use my supply of food and water to wait out the ten days till the farmers arrive. However, if I wait ten days to be saved, I’ll end up missing the awesome Theta Tau recruitment events this week! Which means I need to find a way out.

Using more of my traveling knowledge, I know Kansas is extremely windy, with wind speeds averaging over 11mph. Using the snowshoes, scrap wood, lasso, and parachute, and the army knife as a tool, I can craft a wind-powered sleigh to ride over the fields to civilization (see drawing). The journey will still take a couple days, so I can use my knife to cut open the soccer ball to store some corn and use the mug to carry water. The apple will provide extra nutrition and flavor to supplement my all-corn diet. Fire from the match will warm me up at night. And finally, the tweezers and mirror will come in handy to pluck my eyebrows and look sharp as I make my epic return to civilization on my sweet ride.

In a city like LA and a university like USC where classes progress rapidly, social groups form immediately, and social events occur nightly, I find myself seeking a community who can guide, push, and inspire me. From lacking the motivation to connect with others through Zoom despite my outgoing nature to believing that summer internship applications could be submitted by March, I made a series of mistakes throughout my freshman year. I believe that joining Theta Tau will help me grow individually, professionally, and socially.","For Theta Tau, I would plan a Donut Dash to assist and financially support COVID-19 meal assistance programs across Los Angeles. Participants of the event would have the option of running 2.5 km, 5 km, or 10 km with the choice of eating donuts at the halfway point and the end of their races. I would charge $30 to adults and $15 to children as part of registration, and all proceeds would be donated to philanthropic organizations in Los Angeles that support those in need through COVID-19 meal programs. The charitable component of the Donut Dash is undoubtedly the priority and focal point. The event would further enable participants to socialize before and after the race while enjoying some donuts. The event would be open to all age groups, regardless of whether one is a high school student, college student, or retiree. Therefore, I believe that the occasion – beyond just a race involving eating donuts – represents inclusion and societal welfare. ","As a student privileged enough to attend USC, I believe that the aspect of service is naturally the most significant one Theta Tau encompasses. Theta Tau’s societal impact, through events and programs relating to beach cleanups, teaching, and volunteering, is one of the reasons I value the organization highly. At this moment in time, however, I hope to make the most out of Theta Tau’s social connections. With my online, Zoom-oriented freshman year passing by in a blur, I have 3 years to maximize my college experience, and I believe that the bonds formed at college are a pivotal aspect of the adventure. When I reminisce about my time at USC in a decade, I hope to recall unforgettable adventures, laughter with friends, and thrilling nights out, which I am confident I can experience at Theta Tau. Moreover, there is an element of diversity in the organization I admire. The prospect of interacting with people of different backgrounds and cultures and forming a tight-knit community that can challenge and inspire me greatly appeals to me.","How I Met Your Mother (TV show), Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell (book), and The Intern (movie)","Disregarding his criminal background and immense power and influence, Don Vito Corleone is the fictional character I believe most accurately represents me. His determination to avoid violence between the crime families and proactivity in resolving disputes mirrors my calm state of mind and approachable nature which help me avoid conflicts. In addition, his unwavering love for his family and warm nature parallel the tremendous affection and gratitude I have for my parents and the sacrifices they made to raise me in a caring environment.","After spending a considerable amount of time on my first day to understand the uses of the materials, I would use the swiss army knife to cut the lasso into four equal lengths. After doing so, I would set up the parachute as a tent and connect it to four trees using the pieces of the lasso. This would create an area to live for the 10 days. I would then create a fire using the strike-anywhere match and the two pieces of scrap wood. As I have a vast supply of corn, I would collect days’ worth of corn and cook it using the fire. The most creative idea of all, I would use the pair of snowshoes as footwear to stay warm. I have a passion for soccer and cannot imagine using a soccer ball for anything other than playing the sport. Therefore, my source of entertainment for the 10 days is guaranteed. When my days’ worth of corn is over, I would split my apple into pieces for the remaining days. On the last day, I would use the mirror to reflect sunlight onto my palm, after which, I would wave my palm back and forth as a distress signal to the farmers entering the area. I would not be able to figure out a way to produce water using the materials I have. Therefore, I would utilize my years of practicing Hinduism to pray to God that it rains during my 10 days in the cornfield.

Abed always compared the daily shenanigans or episode plot to a pop-culture reference, using it as a way to cope and predict what happens next. To him, it helps him rationalize everything that goes on. Along with that, he has a close connection to Troy like no other which I also relate to (having few, but meaningful relationships). I myself often use analogies and references to learn and get through my days. By comparing my experiences with anything at all that makes sense, it helps me get through what I need to do.

On the night of Day 9, (right before day 10) I would use my one match and the two pieces of scrap wood to make a large fire with any other kindling materials I can find. This is in hopes that the farmers will notice the smoke from the fire on their way here, and come quicker knowing that there is someone stranded out here, thus shortening the wait until help comes.

In the second part, all the groups will be asked to create a marketing strategy for their product. This part may consist of naming the product, how it will be advertised and etc. The last part will consist of the final plan for the group’s innovation. The final plan can be a drawing, or a code, or anything! I really think this type of innovation event will be really beneficial for the members of Theta Tau. First of all, it helps you to improve your creation skills, because you have to come up with something in the span of 60 minutes. Also, you will explore some of the ways on how to promote a product and how to make it buyable for the customer. Lastly, it will help you to improve your skills in working in a group and learning the steps of innovation at the same time.","First of all, I really believe that college experience in USC is more than just the gpa and other academic activities. As an international student, I want to make use of all the social aspects in Theta Tau and have as much fun as possible in the social and service activities. However, in my opinion what distincts Theta Tau from other organizations is the Professionalism part. I am pretty confident that there are many organizations on campus, in which you can have a lot of fun, but I do not think there is another organization that can give you valuable information about the industry and improve your skills in professionalism. Having the opportunity to make mock interviews with people from different companies really helps me to improve my interview skills, which I really believe that I should be better at. Additionally, the fact that you get to communicate with representatives from big companies enables you to learn some information that is not possible to learn from the internet. In conclusion, I really believe that the Professionalism part of Theta Tau will be a great experience for me, which will improve my chance of employment after graduation.

In case you may think what happens if there is no rain? However, the corn will only survive if there is some amount of water. So, if the area was a non-raining area, there would be no corn. I would also wear one of the snowshoes to my hand so that I can protect myself if any wild animal attacks me during the 10 days. On the first night, I will try to make a campfire using branches of corn and one of the pieces of scrap wood by the help of the single strike anywhere match.

But the more I learned about the organization, the more I realized it would give me everything I wanted — an opportunity to do hands-on service, connect with professionals, and find people interested in the same things as me. But what pushed me over the edge was talking to the actives and seeing how fun everyone was. Serving, connecting, and bonding with those people is how I want to spend my remaining time at USC.","Big engineering firms are often looking for ways to help their communities as part of their brand marketing, usually doing events that connect with their organization’s mission. Companies like Google and Facebook often do service events for less fortunate children.  As a service organization, Theta Tau is uniquely positioned to help these companies hold these events. My event would bring an employee from an engineering firm and actives in Theta Tau together to teach engineering to students who might not usually have the opportunity to interact with those in the industry. 

Many high schools in underprivileged neighborhoods do not offer engineering courses, so this event would be a great way to introduce students into the field. Moreover, they would be able to hear from both professionals and college students, allowing them to hear about learning and working in an engineering field. Hopefully these stories will provide inspiration for these students to explore engineering. 

For the members of Theta Tau, not only does this represent a service opportunity, but it also is a great networking opportunity, as they will be able to bond with the professional and get more insight into their experiences. ","Because of my privilege as a student at USC, giving back to the community has become an important goal for me. My other clubs have helped me work alongside nonprofits in order to improve their efficiency and help the most people possible in the LA area. However, work in these clubs can often feel very disconnected from the actual people I am trying to help. It’s easy to forget that these are real people with stories, families, and lives. 

Theta Tau is the perfect way for me to remember this by doing hands-on service. Not only can I sit face-to-face with the people I am trying to help, but I can also hear about their lives and remember the humanity in everything I do. At the same time, these events also surround engineering, allowing me to use my strengths to give back. Most importantly, the community at Theta Tau means that I will be surrounded by friends at every event, making it even more enjoyable. ","Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Psych, Booksmart ","Besides the obvious name similarities, I share a lot of characteristics with Ron Weasley. Movies in general do a bad job of representing normal people, but I think Ron is a pretty good example. He’s a little bit awkward and clueless, just like me, but he’s also funny, sweet, and can be brave at times. While I won’t say I have the same wizardry as him, I am just as imperfect, and at the same time have redeeming qualities that allow me to save the world all the same.","As I take a seat in this random junkyard, I think about where my life has brought me. The situation is pretty sad, but what’s even sadder is how I got in this position in the first place. Why am I traveling so much through rural Kansas that I can recognize a random cornfield? And why am I traveling by horse? I’m literally relying on things I found in a random junkyard to keep me alive. Forget surviving – I should be using these next 10 days to make some serious life changes. 

The basic necessities should be easy enough; I can pick corn from the nearby cornfield for food and collect water in the mug whenever I need from the sprinklers or drip irrigation that waters the corn. I can sleep in the junkyard itself, using folded up leaves as a pillow and the parachute as a blanket. 

As for my future, I use my time to pick up the only skill accessible to me: soccer. I prop up the mirror and begin working on my game. I also use the scrap wood along with anything around me to workout to improve my conditioning. Even though it’s a pretty slim chance that I can make a living out of soccer, 10 days should give me a pretty good shot. At the very worst, it’s a goal worth working towards, instead of being stuck riding my horse around rural Kansas for the rest of my life. ",,"Last year, I found some of my closest friends through clubs online. We got close through the work we did and just by talking about whatever. But while hanging out with them virtually was fun, I missed the experience of doing the things I love with real people.

It would be a great opportunity to make friends and form connections. I think that I would also benefit from the structure of having a commitment every week other than just my schoolwork. It would also open doors like being of benefit through the service aspect, and gaining a better understanding of the world of engineering. ","The event that comes to mind is a social one, a potluck! I love cooking and I think that food is one of the greatest ways to share an experience with others. My ideal potluck would be held outside and would, of course, consist of everyone bringing a homemade dish to share. Being in charge of planning, I would create a spreadsheet with different categories that people could sign up for, and we would use compostable dishes and silverware. As with any good social event, it would also include music and a good vibe! ","I would say that the service pillar is the most important one to me.

Especially in a school the size of USC, sometimes it's easy to get overwhelmed and it would be nice to have some solid friends to lean on. Moreover, it would be nice to have the networking that being a part of Theta Tau entails to help my professional career.","If I could plan one event for Theta Tau I would probably do one related to social. Being a pretty social person in high school, I think that planning a social event would be the most fun for me. For the social, I would probably just plan like a beach day where everyone can bring snacks, drinks, and games to play for the day time. After that, everyone goes home and showers then meets back up to party at some venue. I think that would be a pretty fun night. Also, maybe there could be a camping social if people don't hate camping.","I think that service is the most important pillar to me because I have seen the impact it can have on people. Two volunteer opportunities I had were with Houston Methodist Hospital and one with camp CAMP. At the hospital I was able to assist in transporting patients from different rooms or from their cars to their rooms and I enjoyed the conversations I had with the patients during this time. I felt that I was able to make their hospital experience feel a little less dreadful and that made me happy. At camp CAMP I was a youth counselor for special needs kids and basically I was their friend for the whole week. I loved hanging out with these kids and helping them forget about their differences and troubles in their lives even if it was for a short period of time. Overall, because of those experiences, service is the most important to me.","Narcos, Supermarket, The DaVinci Code","I think the best fictional character that represents me is Johnny Test and not just because people have said I look like him. Like me, Johnny Test seems like a pretty energetic guy who may sometimes fight with family, but in the end always puts family first. Moreover, he loves his dog and I love animals as well. Lastly he is kind of STEM related since he always participates in his sister's experiments and I am STEM kind of too.","First of all, who would want to go to Kansas or anywhere near there. But hypothetically, if that did happen, I would first have to find a source of water to live as the body can live around 8-10 days with just water. Having secured water, I would probably eat some insects and my apple for my food source. If it gets cold in the night I will collect some wood and use my match to start a fire and wear my snowshoes to keep my feet war. I will also probably make a shelter with some wood if that is possible. I think that covers most of the survival stuff so now I have to worry about how to entertain myself. For sure I would play lots of soccer by myself if I still have the energy; I would probably just kick it around or dribble it like a basketball or try to hit it in the air like a volleyball. I guess since I have tweezers and a mirror, I'll do my best to keep myself looking presentable when the farmers come. Assuming that there are livestock since it is the middle of nowhere I'll also try to learn how to use the lasso like some sort of cowboy. Hopefully, that will be enough to last me ten days.",,"I am mostly looking forward to meeting new people, exploring LA, and the weather.

It’s not solely the diversity of race and background, but rather, the aggregate, offering an unparalleled diversity of thought and interest. This is my second time applying to Theta Tau because I want to take part in this multi-faceted organization. Theta Tau is not only a place where I can find peers of the same major but a place where I can collaborate with engineers of different fields. I believe in this community of scholars to challenge and prepare me for my future endeavors.","What could be better than playing Minecraft with a bunch of engineers? The event I would organize would be a Minecraft Social event. This will be a week-long build-a-thon where the fraternity is broken up into teams. Each team will have the same goal, which is to replicate the USC campus to the best of their ability on Minecraft by the end of the week. This event will challenge the teams’ teamwork and planning while giving members a fun opportunity to showcase their creative side. I am sure that through several days of work and competition, the members will grow closer and make lasting memories. ","They say that it takes around ten thousand hours to master an ability. I live by this motto in my everyday life, striving to perfect my skills for my hobbies and interests. Admittedly, when it comes to computer science, I might be slightly behind the curve as I switched into the major only one semester ago. With that being said, I strongly believe that my work ethic will set me on a good pace to achieve the ten-thousand-hour mark. 

The pillar that I value the most from Theta Tau, as a result, is Professionalism. I see the professional aspect of Theta Tau as an invaluable resource in helping me become a well-rounded applicant for my future career. I plan on making the most of the professional events, whether it is tightening up my interview skills or polishing my resume; I am sure that the brothers of Theta Tau will guide me in the right direction. On the same note, when it comes time for me to fill the role as the mentor, I want to share the wealth of knowledge that I have collected with my underclassmen like the alumni before me have done.

I embody many character traits that Po possesses as I am usually easygoing, playful, and resilient. In times of stress, I, like Po like to gorge on food to take my mind off things. In Kung Fu Panda, Po goes from an uncoordinated panda to a Dragon Warrior. After only changing to computer science last semester, like Po, I believe that I too can become the “Dragon Warrior” equivalent of my field. ","In a situation where I am stranded alone in a cornfield in Kansas, my focus will be entertaining myself for 10 days. This is because of the nature of my surroundings. Being in a cornfield tells me that basic survival necessities like food and water will not be an issue. I can rely on eating corn until I get found and cornfields have a watering system. I can use the mug to collect and drink water. I will use the supplies provided to build a temporary shelter. The material of the parachute serves as a durable cover, while I can use the pieces of scrap wood to prop up the parachute, effectively creating a tent-like structure. The matches will help me start a fire at night and I will use corn stalk as fuel. The Swiss Army Knife will come in handy when it comes to building. With the basic survival requirements met, all that is left is to come up with entertainment.  With whatever is left, I will come up with games to play. By the end of the 10 days, I can see myself becoming a master free-style juggler of the soccer ball and possess lasso skills that Texans will be proud of. Starting from easiest to hardest, I will work my way up from lassoing a mirror, to snowshoes, to an apple, and finally tweezers. Maybe I will even become the first lassoing freestyle juggler, an act nobody thought could be done together.

It wasn’t until I spoke with the actives that I noticed them laughing and talking like they had known each other forever. They remembered small details about each other’s lives and asked them about it. I expected a competitive, serious organization but I realized that everyone has fun and wants to help each other out. I want to join Theta Tau because I love the fun and welcoming atmosphere it has on top of an engineering foundation. ","I would plan a social event called “Theta Tau’s Ninja Warriors.” There’s no better way to bond than to group up and have a fun competition. There would be a moderately difficult obstacle course and each member attending would be sorted into groups. There would also be a photographer so that members can look back on the day and reminisce on the amazing memories made. The “Theta Tau’s Ninja Warriors” itinerary would include a morning of racing, announcing winners, then eating lunch and the day will end with a karaoke concert. The losing teams will have to perform a song (choreography welcomed) that is chosen by the winners. In terms of preparing the course, the goal is that the engineering mindset will kick in and members will be able to create a DIY-course with upcycled materials. Do I have the financial logistics worked out for this event? Maybe not. What I do have is the inspirational quote, “T.EA.M.: Together Everyone Achieves More.” Social events are important towards team building and a strong team builds morale, boosts productivity, and pushes members to create the best version of their team. Go Theta Tau Ninja Warriors! ","Although the social aspect of Theta Tau initially drew me in, I think service is the most important pillar of the organization. Growing up, my hometown didn’t have programs that introduced STEM projects outside of the classroom so I never thought it was a field I could get into. However, I appreciate how Theta Tau’s past service events have been geared towards increasing access to science and technology for children. It wasn’t until a friend a couple years older than me convinced me to try out science fair that I thought that there might be room for me in STEM-fields. Older students can be really influential towards younger students and it’s important that younger students understand that science and technology are not out of their reach. I love to work with children and I want to introduce them to new science topics or projects that might inspire them to learn more about the STEM-field. I want to pay forward the help that I received from other people and I would love to be part of future Theta Tau service projects.

This is a strength and precision building tactic disguised as entertainment. Another workout disguised as entertainment would be parachute running. Essentially, I want to build muscle and stamina in the case of a Children of the Corn scenario. To keep myself warm and to hide from children of the corn at night, my parachute will be used as a blanket. If I were to be murdered by a cult of children, I would want to at least look cute before I go. Thus, the mirror and tweezers will be used for shaping my eyebrows. Now that I’m tired from working out and doing my eyebrows, I will use the Swiss army knife to cut and eat the corn. I would use the tip of the snowshoes to mush and squeeze liquid out of the corn.

People interested in my major, giving to the community through service, gaining professional connections and experience, and having fun with amazing people while doing it.","If I were to organize an event for Theta Tau, I would focus on service. One project that I have personally been a part of, and I think everyone should participate in at least once in their life, is volunteering for Habitat for Humanity. We would help build and repair affordable housing in LA in a sustainable way, and connect with each other and the residents of the community while doing so. No experience is needed to participate, and everyone leaves learning about necessary life and construction skills such as painting, framing, siding, drywall, etc. I think this is especially important for engineering students because hands-on construction, while less complex than creating a machine, engine, electrical circuit, or even a code, gives the foundation of what building and creating is all about. Working with others to figure out the most ideal solution, and then immediately seeing the results of your hard work is an experience that I think would be a great way for Theta Tau members to bond with one another and the community right outside of our bubble of USC. Also, I think a karaoke night, talent show, or lego building competition would be super fun. ","While all three pillars of Theta Tau are important to me in their own right, what sets it apart from any other community service club, sorority, etc. are the professional connections. To be able to attend panels, networking events, mock interviews, and so much more for my field of interest is an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. I have always heard that the USC network is real, but I also know it’s up to me to get involved and put myself out there in said network, and Theta Tau would allow me to do just that. Already talking to the upperclassmen members and hearing their plans for the future, I am excited at the prospect of being given similar opportunities. Moving to such a big city with so many people around me that seem so much smarter and more qualified than I am, it can be a little intimidating to put myself out into the professional world.

But I’ve learned to use my voice over the years, and actively seek out what I want in life, not just wait for it to be given to me. She had priorities and she went after and achieved her goals, and I have so much respect for that.","The obvious answer would be to call my horse with my special whistle call that only we know, feed her an apple for energy, and then ride her all the way to freedom. But if for whatever crazy reason that doesn’t work, my top priority would be to find water. Assuming that there is some sort of irrigation system or river nearby, I would track whatever wildlife I could find and follow it back to a water source. Once at water, I’d build a fire by harvesting corn stalks and leaves, and use the mirror to direct the sunlight to burn them. I would then immediately put water in the mug and boil the water to purify it. Once that is all set up, my next priority is a shelter. I would use the scrap wood and corn stalks as support and then the parachute as a sort-of tent to create my shelter. Then, I would cut the soccer ball in half to create a bowl, where I could pour my boiling water from the fire, and boil corn in to eat. And then use the other half as a cute hat, or as a bowl for the popcorn I also will figure out how to make. So now with food, water, shelter, and fire, all I need to do is pass time. I would learn how to weave corn leaves to create a rug or a basket, use the snowshoes and rope to try to make a trap to catch animals, eat the apple and use the seeds to start an apple farm, and then after all of that, the farmers should arrive.

I had some generic “to meet new people and make professional connections” before, but after attending the event I decided to rewrite this application. As an introvert, I was, or still am, always intimidated by networking, but the actives made the experience so much easier. I was awkwardly standing there eating my first ice cream (yes, I ate two) when a group of people just walked up to me and introduced themselves. It gave me the confidence I needed to get a second ice cream and talk to other groups. ","	I would plan an event for Profession/Social pillar. The perfect opportunity for me is a group internship at an engineering company in its first 10 or 20 years. Even though I don’t think group internships are that common in college, I really like them because peers can bond over professional development, killing two birds with one stone. As for the age of the company, if it’s too young, it can’t accommodate a group internship, and some people may be left in the cold. Some well-established companies actually do have opportunities for a group of student to work on a project or go through professional training, but my ideal internship is at a younger firm where I can get my hands on multiple aspects of the company instead of being locked to a fixed program. If the ratio of the company size to interns is just right, every intern can be fully immersed in their own areas of the company while working towards a common goal. Solving multi-faceted real-life problems with professionals and peers under pressure just sounds super enticing to me. ","	The Social pillar is the most important to me, because I think it serves as a foundation for the other two. A big reason for why I chose to join an engineering society is because I wished for a platform that made engineering resources and advice accessible, something I desperately need as a sophomore that spent his freshmen year online. While this may sound more like the Professionalism pillar, I believe that by making genuine connections with the other members, these pathways to academic or career success will automatically open up. Even today at the ice cream social, there were numerous times when I was drifting between groups and someone will call me over like “hey Wein, aren’t you a mech E? Yeah he’s also in it, y’all should talk”.
	Similarly, Service is built upon the desire to help others, something I believe to be a key aspect of building any relationship. Whether that’s a relationship with the people you’re helping or with other members, they can all tie into the Social pillar. While Professionalism and Service are just as important, I choose Social because it feels the most encompassing of the three pillars. ","Sex education, my hero academia, re:zero","I would say Kenma Kozume from the volleyball anime Haikyuu. He’s a quiet, collected guy, which may appear to some as being cold and apathetic. He always keeps a cool head, keeping his advantage in volleyball using his brain instead of brawn. However, it’s shown that he gets emotional when it comes to the things he like, partly fueled by his secret competitive side, and he cares about those around him by noticing small details about them. In general, I think he represents me pretty well, with the only difference being that I’m not as smart and I’m relatively more outgoing/playful. ","	The easy way out would be to set the cornfield on fire with the match so farmers will come put it out and find me in the process. I’ll need to remove all flammable materials from the junkyard so I don’t burn to death, and I can also use the scrap wood, lasso, and parachute to set up a shield against the direction of wind to block soot and fumes. While waiting, I’ll munch on the apple and some corn I’ve collected ahead of time. 
	Otherwise, I’ll find water first. Even though it doesn’t rain too much in Kansas around this time, hopefully there will be some kind of automated irrigation system in the fields. If not I can crush corn for their juices, or soak up dew and ground water with my shirt and purify it by boiling it. As for food, eating only corn for 10 days will leave you quite malnourished as corn can’t be easily digested right off the cob. You probably won’t die, but it’s definitely not an experience I want to have. Boiling corn with some lye can solve this problem, which can be made by boiling wood ash in water and collecting the top layer. It probably works without lye too, but if I have 10 free days I might as well improve my diet. Fires can easily be started with wood shavings and the mirror during the day. With food and water satisfied, I’m gonna try my hand at wood sculpting.",,"	Having my entire freshmen year online, I didn’t feel like I was in college at all. It was just an extension of highschool online class, and I still mistakenly introduce myself as a freshman now sometimes. Thus, I think I look forward most to establishing a solid college routine, aka figuring out my clubs, friend groups, and leisure activities. With USC having 1000+ clubs, this is definitely at the top of list right now, since once I secure my clubs and meeting times, I think everything else can fall in place relatively smoothly.

I want a familiar sense of community that I’ve lacked in my 3 years at USC in my experience ranging from entrepreneurship organizations to IFC Fraternities. As a first generation college student from Dubai, I was able to interact with members that had similar experiences. Moreover, I am confident that I share a similar sense of purpose and professionalism as the awesome members I interacted with! 
","ServiceWhile I have some ideas for Professional and Social Events, I would definitely plan a Service event. I have been extremely interested in making education more accessible and tailored to student’s needs in alignment with the NAE Grand Challenge: “Advance Personalized Learning”. Growing up, I was completely obsessed with ‘learning how to learn’ and being a first generation college student, I understand more than anyone the importance and impact of education on opportunity. While I’ve previously developed CS curricula for schools in India, I’ve recently become interested in improving learning for differently-abled students, and am in the process of developing web-based tools for K-12 teachers.

For the event, I would’ve loved to work with schools in the neighbourhood and teach stem, but that overlaps with a pre-existing Theta Tau initiative. Instead, I would love to hold college preparatory events at nearby schools, 1) to emphasize the need for a higher education, 2) help prepare for the college application process, 3) search for colleges based on their unique interests and financial needs, and 4) build a support system for eager students.This initiative would serve to increase equal opportunity in education and provide students with the resources to set them on the right track to navigate college, which can be especially difficult for first generation students that have little or no guidance. 

I can speak on this topic for days so ask me about it! :)
","I do think that I hope to get the most out of all three pillars at Theta Tau. As a freshman I engaged with the South-LA community by working as a soccer coach for elementary students through Trojan Youth Soccer League and would love to continue that in a more academic setting through the Service initiatives at Theta Tau. Similarly, as a senior looking for full-time opportunities, the Professional initiatives will definitely provide a huge value add going forward and I will be bringing my own experiences of recruiting for internships over the last three years to the Kappa Epsilon chapter. 

However, it is the Social Pillar that I hope to get the most out of! In my time at USC, I’ve only engaged with engineers in a classroom setting. Taking ENGR 499 last semester as part of the Innovation track of the Viterbi Honors program, I finally understood what I was missing out on. I hope to learn from the various majors in Theta Tau while also sharing my unique experiences as not just a Computer Scientist but also an aspiring entrepreneur! I want to leverage the Social initiatives to participate in an all encompassing engineering community at USC.
",So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love by Cal Newport (Book) | Yes Man (Movie) | Limitless (Movie and TV Show),"I think ‘Marshall Eriksen’ from ‘How I Met Your Mother’ best represents me. Not just based on personality types (we are both INFP), but also the character that I relate to the most. From the get go of the show Marshall is portrayed to have a ‘work hard play hard’ attitude, which I deeply resonate with. Furthermore, his ability to switch between his analytical & logical side for his work as a lawyer and his deeply emotional side for his personal life is one that I’ve always tried to emulate as a CS major.
","After getting my bearings, I realize that all hope is not lost. I decide to satisfy the basic goals of survival, namely - food, water, clothing, and shelter. I clear out a large chunk of land, est. 8x8 metres, near the junkyard and pile the corn stalks to the side. Then I dig up some deep roots and crush them with my swiss army knife over my mug to get as much water as I can, restocking my water supply. Once done, I proceed to set up a canopy using the parachute, the two scraps of wood, and the (ted) lasso to get away from the hot sun. I dehusk the corn and let it cook in the Kansas sun. I then put on the snowshoes because they look amazing and who doesn’t want free kicks. With my basic needs barely met, I start thinking of a way out. Having learned about prescribed burns, I decide to give them a shot to attract attention because I noticed that the mirror was (surprise surprise) concave and can start a fire with the sun’s rays. I move to a downwind piece of farmland that is sufficiently away from my campsite and start ripping corn stalks for the next couple days to create a basic fire line and gather some of the husks to use as combustible material. Using the mirror I start a controlled fire to attract the farmers. If it doesn’t attract them, then I’ll just have popcorn for days. (win-win)",,"I am looking forward to a lot of things this semester: in-person classes, campus events, normal-ish life, etc. I am most excited about reconnecting with the USC community. While I am an international student, I was lucky enough to come back to LA for Fall 20 and Spring 21. However, it was definitely disheartening to see the campus deserted and lifeless, so with classes back in person (for the time being), I’m trying to make the most by meeting old friends and making new ones, in a Covid safe manner of course!",Yes,"Sep 9th, 4:00pm",He/him/His

I also know that Theta Tau can help prepare me for industry as a software engineer, with it’s professional networking events, resume reviews, and large body of CS students as peer resources. I am also passionate about community service, so I would be thrilled to organize and participate in meaningful service events (especially relating to minority representation in STEM) with Theta Tau.","I would love to organize a combined service/social event to help support a meaningful cause while also connecting with active members in Theta Tau. We could hold a bake sale on the McCarthy Quad, with 100% of the proceeds going to a minority science organization, such as NSBE or oSTEM. These organizations help to empower and fund people of color and LGBT in STEM fields to further diversity in science and technology sectors, which is something I am really passionate about. To make this into a more social event, all active members could come together (maybe in the Theta Tau house) to bake and decorate for this sale. It would be so much fun making cookies, brownies, cakes, pies, and other baked goods together or decorating them while hanging out. We could even make engineering-themed items like cookies shaped into gears, beakers, robots, etc. During the bake sale we could play music and hang out, all while donating to a meaningful cause!","As a transfer student, it can be incredibly difficult to make genuine connections on campus without many of the shared freshman experiences of dorms, dining halls, and orientation events. A lot of the students in Viterbi have been taking classes together for years, so coming in as a Junior can feel pretty intimidating. Although I have met so many incredible people in just the last few weeks, I know that I ultimately want a deeper sense of community here at USC, especially with other engineering students. I believe the social pillar of Theta Tau is a great opportunity to find that at USC and ultimately build lifelong friendships that truly mean something. One of the great things about a society like Theta Tau is that professional and service events often lend themselves as great experiences for social growth as well. In that sense, I actually believe all three pillars will ultimately help me make the most of my social experience at USC. ","Blade Runner, Frozen, The Politician","I definitely feel like Ron Weasley from the Harry Potter movies is a great representation of me. Though we are sometimes clumsy, I think Ron and I are both well-intentioned, thoughtful, and kind people. Just like how Ron is always willing to set aside his fears to help Harry, I would do anything and everything for my friends and family! We are both excitable, loving, and always ready to lend a hand, albeit sometimes nervous in new situations. Not to mention that we are both TERRIFIED of spiders (literally my worst fear)! ","First, I would get a fire started using the strike-anywhere match and a bit of dried corn husks from the field. Once I have that fire going, I can keep the embers alive and relight it as needed without needing another match. If the fire goes out for good, I can get more dried corn husks and position the mirror in a way that concentrates light onto that area (like a magnifying glass) to hopefully get a new flame. For food I would first find a big wooden stick, use the swiss army knife to make both ends sharp, and then put pieces of corn onto it from the field to roast over the fire every night (ugh now i'm hungry haha). I can use the mug to boil drinking water as well. To fight off boredom, I would make a makeshift soccer net to practice kicking the soccer ball into. I could push the two pieces of scrap wood into the ground as posts, wrap the parachute around both as a net, and tie it all together using the lasso. Assuming the snow shoes are more traditional and made of wood and string, I could use it as a racket and try to keep bouncing the apple higher and higher until it falls off (like when you bounce a tennis ball on a tennis racket to pass time).

Consequently, a community like Theta Tau is very appealing because I know that being surrounded by so many passionate and interesting people within Viterbi will help me become the best version of myself I can be. Additionally, I can recognize one of my weaknesses is my business acumen and communication skills. I found the CSBA program very enticing for that reason because it will force me to become a more adept business leader while studying what I love(CS), but I recognize that I'll have to put in the work to get there. I believe having Theta Tau to support and aid me through professional workshops and networking opportunities would be too big of an advantage to not try for. ","One of the last major community service events I did was being a camp counselor for five days; it was absolutely draining and very cold(during the winter up by Mariposa County/outskirts of Yosemite, if you're familiar), but I loved it and adored the kids in my cabin. Seeing all their personality come through as they enjoyed a week surrounded by their friends in the snow with no homework or parents insight was always the highlight of my day. With that, Community Service is a really important aspect of my life, and although I've done other things since being a camp counselor, I've always wanted to work with kids in a larger capacity again.  As a young boy, I remember I was very academically uninspired and treated school as a big opportunity to socialize more than to learn, which got me in a lot of trouble later. If I could plan something or get involved in an event that deals with children and teaching them the importance of STEM and how cool it can be, I imagine it would be incredibly fulfilling. ","Community service is the pillar I find most fulfilling because I love helping people, and assisting people genuinely makes me happy. So, In fact, in many ways, I would say I do so at a detriment to myself. It's a bit of a problem in the way that if someone asks for help and I know I can help them, I will go out of my way to do so even if it means dropping whatever I was doing, which seldom is the right call. This is something I need to work on, and thanks to my communications class, I'm starting to realize it's actually just a personality thing. Ideally, I would like to be more balanced and take as much as I give or at least be somewhere in-between. That being said, I think it would be untrue to say that community service isn't the most important pilar for me personally, but I do believe to grow I need to be more balanced and get more out of the social and professional side of Theta Tau and treat all pillars like equal. ","Brooklyn 99, DAVE(hulu), Arrested Development(Michael Bluths character!!!!!!!!1!) <-not technically explaining why","Michael Bluth's character from Arrested Development without a doubt, I was just writing about this a few prompts ago I try way too hard to help others to my own detriment. I love Michael Bluth’s character his mannerism are also very similar to mine, and we portray ourselves to others similarly I'd say. This was kinda a cop out because I already mentioned him, I think I can also be similar to Kelly from the first few seasons of the office. My friends say I change the subject unintentionally frequently and bring up the most random facts/subjects just because I feel like my mind is literally having a side convo with itself constantly, and it's really easy to check out of what ever is going on around me, I also can very easily go on long tangents...I'd like to think I'm not as needy, though. Probably should see a professional, but we haven't got there yet. ","Where there are crops there has to be irrigation and I believe as far as water consumers go corn is pretty up there. I would for sure try to figure out where the water is coming from and tap it using the Swiss army knife. According to google, you water corn once a week, so I’m not dying by dehydration, which is always a plus. I would hold onto the lasso in case my horse came back corn stalks make great horse treats, so I imagine it wouldn’t have gone far. If the soil is very muddy I might hold onto the snowshoes, if not I don't think I see a point in holding onto it. An apple sitting in the junkyard doesn't sound particularly appetizing and if I got sick the chances of dehydration will grow exponentially, so I guess it would depend on how it's looking, but let it be known there is a world where I would turn down one of the few sources of food in sight. The ball could be a good way to pass time, so I'm taking it with me, although I don't imagine without food I'd have much energy to play with it. The mirror is coming in case the match is a dud, I can use it as a makeshift magnifying glass. Absolute worst case scenario it's day 11 and no one has showed up, I'll whip out the match or mirror and set fire to the place; someone will have to call it in and authorities will come(right?).

My favorite types of events were food bagging or donation events. Back at my community college, I really prioritized the importance of the food and shelter insecure student population, and organized various events that highlighted those issues. I would love to consider some events like that at USC. One example could be partnering with USC Basic Needs, local food banks, and donation centers to create basic needs packages to give to students that cannot afford food, hygiene products, and etc. I also loved to organize alumni events, where current students would be able to talk with school alumni (whether they have transferred or have a job) to discuss career path options. ","As of right now, I hope to improve my social skills. I always considered myself to be a social butterfly, but these past two years have completely changed that. Having to do everything virtually has taken a huge toll on how I would approach or start a conversation with someone. My social skills need quite a bit of improvement, so I hope that my time in Theta Tau will be the boost I need. This is not only in general social skills with peers, but even networking with industry professionals and higher level staff. Socializing is key in being successful in the long run, and I hope to learn a couple new things from Theta Tau.","The Fifth Book of Peace, #Alive, Away","Russell from Up.

Since I am stranded in a cornfield, I would cut down corn stalks to create a circular flat piece of land. The corn stalks at the edges of that circle would be brought into a cone shape (almost like a tiki) and tied with the lasso to hold tight. The cut down corn, scrap wood, and single strike-anywhere match would be used to keep warm and provide with a healthy amount of food. The fire would also be used to char the corn in order to actually enjoy it. Since corn will be enough to eat, maybe the apple and knife could also be used as a game (sort of like darts). Of course the corn would be watered at some point, so the mug could be used to collect water. The parachute would make a great blanket, and snow shoes obviously to wear.",,"Since this is my first time being in LA, I would love to learn more about the city.

I know that through Theta Tau, with people as ambitious as I am, I will have the opportunity to grow professionally and socially, while helping those in our community. This is the kind of meaningful experience and community that I came to USC looking for.","I would love to plan an event where engineers from different companies come to an underserved public school in Los Angeles to explain what their company does, what a day at their job entails, and an overview of the course of their career. This would allow these underprivileged students to gain exposure to career paths that they may not have previously known about. Each member of Theta Tau would be responsible for reaching out and connecting with one person in the field of engineering who would be willing to come and represent their company. Then, these engineers could go around to different classrooms and share their stories and answer any questions that students may have. The members of Theta Tau would be in these classrooms too, facilitating the conversation between the students and the engineer. This event would allow these young students a glimpse into the world of engineering and would hopefully maybe inspire them to enter the field. Furthermore, this event would also allow the members of Theta Tau to network with different engineers in the fields that they are interested in and build more personal connections with them, something that could be very beneficial when finding an internship or job.","What I hope to gain most from Theta Tau is a community of people that I will be able to turn to for anything and who will be able to reach out to me for anything as well. I believe that people are the foundation—the cause, the reason, and the effect—of anything we do and therefore I feel that the social pillar is the most important to me. I look forward to meeting some incredible people who I hope will become my acquaintances, friends, mentors, or any other impactful relationships that will affect the course of my career. And with this community of people, I will be able to explore the other two pillars of Theta Tau: service and professionalism. With the support of many engineers, I will have the opportunity to plan service events that will positively impact more people to a greater extent, and with the help of mentors from Theta Tau, I hope to grow professionally.

Throughout the show, George O’Malley is a little awkward and often does not perform as well as his peers, but he always was honest to himself and others, prioritized compassion, and chose to appreciate life’s unpredictability. In my own life filled with ups and downs and challenges and successes, I both relate to and aspire to live the way George O’Malley chose to live.","	The following must be considered when planning survival anywhere: food, water, shelter. However, none of these are concerns in this situation. As an Ohioan, I know a thing or two about cornfields. Firstly, corn, even raw, is edible and nutritious. Second, because this is a corn field, there must be an irrigation system that distributes freshwater, and we can collect and drink this water. Lastly, the ground is perfectly safe to sleep on.
The most important consideration now is entertainment to keep us from going insane in these next ten days. Here, I have curated a list of some possibly fun things we can do with what we have:
- Stick one piece of wood into the ground to stand it up vertically. Use the lasso to secure the apple to the top of the wood. Call out the name of our horse and pray that it comes back.
- Create a small fire with the match and some corn stalks. Roast some corn on the cob.
- Using that same fire, make a hot air balloon. Plant the fire in the mug and then attach it to the parachute. Allow the hot air to fill the parachute, causing the hot air balloon to float. Enjoy this for a few seconds before the hot air balloon inevitably comes straight back down.
- Start a wildfire.
- Stick the two pieces of scrap wood in the ground a few feet apart. Use corn stalks to weave a net and attach to both pieces of wood. Practice kicking the soccer ball into this goal.
- Look in the mirror and tweeze those eyebrows.

I look forward most to eventually finding all my favorites of different things—restaurants, hiking trails, people, hang-out spots, beaches, and shops—so that maybe, by the end of this school year, LA will no longer be an intimidating, untouchable city, but rather a tangible place I can call home.",Yes,"Sep 9th, 2:30pm",she/her

I would also relish the opportunity to connect with professionals in my industry while having events to facilitate my growth into the workforce. ","The one event that I would plan for Theta Tau would be service-oriented and one with social aspects. I would plan the event around building and planting a garden in a neighborhood where fresh produce is less common. It would be an excellent project for the Theta Tau community because it would allow everyone to accomplish something lasting and meaningful while also allowing members to connect in the outdoors. I think that laboring on a project close to good friends would create even tighter connections. I would also incorporate some fun and friendly competitions to the project to provide a lighter atmosphere and not feel like it’s all work. Some examples of these activities would be races to pull weeds or place mulch. There would, of course, be plenty of food provided to everyone so that everyone could share a nice break. The most important aspect of this project is that it would help an underserved community both in the present and future. ","The pillar of Theta Tau that I feel is the most important to me is the Social pillar because of the lasting bonds created between members of Theta Tau. Theta Tau provides a unique opportunity for me to meet new people who are moving along a similar path as mine and can help with the struggles along the way. I want to meet people that I can rely on, and from everything interaction that I’ve had, Theta Tau is the place for that to happen. I also think that the Social pillar connects to every experience at USC and, more specifically, at Theta Tau. The people that I hope to meet here will be by my side through both the service work and the professional undertakings that I will experience at Theta Tau, which is why the Social pillar stood out so much. I can’t wait to get to know fellow members at events and retreats, and bond with the older members by learning from their experiences.

I also think that elements of the Hulk and Banner’s dual-sided nature go along with my personality. When it comes to competition or something I am genuinely passionate about, I become like the Hulk in how intensely I hope to accomplish what I set out to do.","If I suddenly woke up stranded in the situation provided, the first thing that I would do is establish a shelter for the night. I would use the lasso to tie the parachute to corn stalks in the cornfield to make a covering just in case it rained. Since I know the area, I would know where any food or water is and go to any place with either of those things. If the cornfield had any ripe corn in it, I would try to eat that. I would eat the apple reasonably quickly so no bugs would get to it since I have nothing to cover it. I would also try to find any high ground to know my surroundings and take advantage of any helpful places to go. I would keep the mug outside during the night to collect any rain or dew that collects overnight. If a plane or car happens to pass by, I will use the mirror to signal it down. If there were ever a freezing night, I could like a fire or take the parachute and wrap myself in it. I used to play soccer in high school so I would kick around the soccer ball. I would use the snowshoes and the swiss army knife to corn stalks into a makeshift goal I could shoot on. I would also try my hand at lassoing things to pass the time. If anything ever attacked me, the snowshoes would come in handy for self-defense. ",,"I am most looking forward to finally being on campus and immersing myself in the culture of USC. The culture is a large part of what drew me to USC, so the aliveness of having everybody back on campus is what’s most thrilling to me. Simply having regular interactions between classes is a relief after spending so much time at home.

The actives have given me amazing advice; for example, I was able to overhaul my Linkedin and resume with advice from Arnav and Max. I also got some great food recommendations—I’m going to try the Boiling Crab soon, and Tacozone was incredible. Theta Tau also has amazing professional resources and networking opportunities; if I was accepted into Theta Tau I would make full use of the Theta Tau network.","I would plan a charity game night. This would involve tournaments for video games, card games, and board games. People would pay a small entry fee and all the profits would be used towards a good cause (perhaps buying meals for local, homeless people).

I think it would be a lot of fun. There would be small prizes for winners. I imagine it would be similar to the Theta Tau's game night, except much larger, with more games, and it would be open to everyone. I think this would be a great event with social and service aspects. ","I would thoroughly enjoy joining a like-minded group that would push me to be my best self. And I think that Theta Tau is exactly that.

The social pillar of Theta Tau is the most important to me. I only have a handful of engineering friends; I switched into Viterbi after freshman year and took all but one of my Viterbi classes online. It would be very encouraging to have like-minded friends who understand what I’m going through in terms of courses, recruiting, and balancing a social life. 

I love how Theta Tau members support each other and thrive together. I would love to be a part of that community. I feel like Theta Tau has a work hard play hard mentality that would help me thrive. I would love to study with friends and help each other out on projects. 

I’ve really enjoyed the Theta Tau recruiting events as well; I imagine joining Theta Tau would be a more fun form of recruitment. I would be able to build on the relationships I’ve started to form. ","Rick and Morty, Friends, The Social Network","When I think of myself, the first words that come to mind are dedicated, loyal, and passionate. I think that the character that best represents me is Jake Peralta from Brooklyn Nine-Nine. While Jake is always having a good time and seemingly never takes anything seriously he is dedicated to his work, is a loyal friend, and at his core is a good person. 

I, myself, never take anything overly seriously; I always try to have a good time. At the same time, however, I am dedicated to my work and commitments. I believe I’m a simple person who tries to enjoy life.","What do you need to survive? FOOD, WATER, and SHELTER. I’m protecting that apple with my life. Using the parachute, the wood and the knife I would create a makeshift tent to shield me from the sun/rain. I’d use the knife to fashion the wood into two stakes that hold up the parachute at two points. I would then use the knife to carve one of the snowshoes into a third stake; this stake could be used as a nail to nail down the other end of a parachute, creating a triangular tent.

I would try to conserve energy to better ration my food and water. As a tired college student, I’d spend the majority of the day catching up on sleep (I finally have an excuse to procrastinate!). I’d use the ball as a pillow in my tent. I’d use the tweezers and mirror to groom myself. It’s probably not the most optimal way to shave, but I’ll build up pain resistance and it would be the cleanest shave ever. It would also kill a lot of time. 

To pass the time, I’d tie up the soccer ball to the large wooden stakes with the lasso; this would create a tetherball like game. I punch the ball or practice my tennis swing and kicks. And when I sleep I could just untie the ball, so I can use it as a pillow.

Also, I’m staying away from the match. I’m not trying to start a prairie fire. ",,"I’m really looking forward to meeting people, spending time with friends, and being outdoors. I spent my entire sophomore year stuck at home in India. I could not meet my friends and I just threw myself into work. I really enjoy meeting new people, so it drove me crazy. I’m going to make up for that this year. I’ve been trying to meet as many new people as possible and I’ve been going to the beach with friends every chance I get.

All the people here are so great — I loved all the actives I met in rush and felt like I clicked well with most if not all of them — and I’m always looking to surround myself with amazing people. Less importantly, I wanted to be a part of an engineering-heavy community for professional development, as it is something I can greatly benefit from.","For Service, I would organize a day-long field day event partnering with the Viterbi K-12 STEM Center to provide an introduction and integration of STEM into younger students’ lives who do not have the resources for exposure to STEM concepts, or opportunities to show them what a career or even an interest in STEM would look like.

I would set up multiple booths, each with a distinct theme (coding, design, building, human bio, etc.) representing the workshop to be held that day, and students can choose which one to go for that day. I would rent out laptops from the center to use for coding and any other activities that may require one. For example, the booth for “building” could have an activity where they design and build a contraption where the goal is to not crack the egg in or on it when dropped from a certain height; the booth for “coding” could have an activity where they learn very basic fundamentals of programming.

Education, especially in underserved communities, is something that I’ll always be a champion for, especially growing up in one when I was younger and having been involved in similar volunteering organizations (such as SCout).","Although I hold all three values to great importance, the Service pillar only slightly outranks the other two. I addressed this briefly in my previous response, but Theta Tau seems to do a lot of service events regarding connecting STEM and underserved communities and underrepresented minorities. This is a cause that I am extremely passionate for, especially because I was once in their shoes: I lacked resources for some time growing up, especially academically. This is something I personally wish was more present in my own childhood and therefore connect very well with Theta Tau’s mission.

Service is also naturally a very fulfilling experience on my end as well, as I strive to make a positive impact on any individual on any given day. I’ve been looking to get back into investing more time giving back to the community, and I believe I can do exactly that with Theta Tau.",(1) It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2) Deadpool (3) Rick and Morty,"Michael from The Good Place: not only are we both ENTPs, with a slightly goofy naïveté and tremendous character development throughout the show, our personalities and values match to a T. He and I are both inquisitive, chipper, and delighted with boundless enthusiasm and curiosity.

Michael inarguably goes through extreme character development throughout the four seasons, which undoubtedly mirrors my own desire for continuous personal growth. And even after unintentionally making friends with those he once viewed as enemies, he only wants the best for them despite the past and even sacrifices his once-held ideals for the greater good.","Since this is a cornfield, I’ll make the assumption corn crops are available at my disposal and will preface this by saying it would be my main source of food (I’ll pay tribute after rescue).

I’d make a contraption with one of the snowshoes and a cut portion of the lasso, propping it up with a stick where the lasso is tied, and leave a piece of apple inside to lure small animals. I’d trap the animal in the netted area of the snowshoe by pulling on the rope when it is inside.

To collect water, I’d cut up the parachute with the army knife and place them over the leaves and plants, tying it tightly with a stone weighing the bag to collect water overnight. I’d use the mug to pour the water I have gathered the next day. I’d likely use the remnants of the parachute to keep myself warm at night. I’d also use the mirror, scrap wood, and possibly leaves to build fire before the sun sets to “cook” and for heat during the nighttime.

Lastly, for entertainment purposes, I’d probably create a makeshift lacrosse stick with the remaining horseshoe and stick, and play a slightly modified version of lacrosse.",,"Honestly, I am just excited to be back after spending 1.5 years away from Los Angeles — Korea and Dallas were great, but it’s been amazing catching up with old friends and meeting new faces.

My experiences at the Theta Tau events were honestly the first time that I truly vibed with a group of people on campus. Whether we were playing “big booty” at game night, fixing my resume at professional night, or just making casual conversation, I always felt comfortable and at-home within the Theta Tau community. The actives that I met weren't just fun to hang out with, they all seemed intelligent and highly-motivated as well. They’re exactly the type of people that I want to surround myself with, as a professional network and, more importantly, as a community. ","If given the opportunity, I’d try to organize a LEGO Technic workshop for underprivileged kids in the LA area. I’ve always loved working with kids – I’ve worked previously as a camp counselor and as a TOPSoccer youth coach – and I think it would be great to expose students to engineering basics at a young age. Technic would work perfectly for this situation, as a subdivision of the LEGO brand that packages more advanced applications of engineering principles into an approachable and engaging LEGO format. While the LEGO kits themselves may certainly be expensive, this also means that they’re something that many kids wouldn’t have access to. With money raised through a GoFundMe or taken from the fraternity’s budget, we could build up a solid collection that could be reused for years, establishing a powerful connection with a deserving and underprivileged community. The event could take place at a school after hours, where Theta Tau members work with students to help them build with either instruction manuals or their own creativity. Collaborating with a youth-oriented non-profit in the LA area could also help with setting up and advertising the event to make it accessible to as many kids as possible.","I think that the social aspect of Theta Tau is ultimately the most important to me. I can always do volunteer and career work on my own, but the brotherhood of Theta Tau is something that would be really difficult to find elsewhere. I absolutely love the idea of spending my time at USC with a like-minded group of engineers, forging relationships that last well beyond our time on campus. I also think that the social pillar is the only one that truly pervades everything that Theta Tau does. While service or professional events are obviously dedicated primarily to their respective pillars, both are also defined by the group of people that you’re doing everything with. I think that the friendships and the people would be the biggest constant for me in Theta Tau, essentially serving as a foundation from which everything else would be built. My Theta Tau brothers and sisters wouldn’t just be my friends for the rest of my life, but also the people that I could potentially be working alongside and serving the community with. ","Calvin and Hobbes, Cars (Pixar), Rick and Morty","It’s not a perfect fit, but Remus Lupin from Harry Potter. We’re both compassionate, reserved, and a tad aloof. His role in his friend group (James, Sirius, and Peter Pettigrew) also fits me particularly well – while I love having fun with my friends, I usually stay the level-headed one in the group. I may not be the craziest person on a night out, but when that person is one of my friends, I will keep them safe. Above all else, Remus and I share a deep loyalty to our loved ones – I would do literally anything for my friends and family. ","The parachute would probably be my most valuable resource as a way to provide shelter. If I was stranded in summer, I would create shade by draping the canopy over the corn stalks and anchoring the cords/lines into the ground with scrap wood. If it was winter, though, I would use the wood to anchor the canopy directly into the ground as a tent-like shelter against the elements (see picture).

Regardless of the season, water would be one of my biggest issues. Though not a guarantee, rain has the potential to be a great source of hydration, and I would build a collection device with a piece cut from the canopy (maybe 16 ft2) and four lengths of rope cut from the lasso. The rope could attach the four corners of the canopy to corn stalks, suspending the contraption above the ground and in direct view of the sky (see picture). Other potential sources of water could come from slicing open corn stems or searching for aquifers/irrigation systems. 

Raw corn would serve as my main source of food, while I’d stow away the apple as an emergency boost of food and water. Entertainment would be a low priority unless rain provided ample drinking water, in which case I’d be happy to work on my juggling and freestyling with the soccer ball. If water proves to be scarce, though, I would hold on to the match and mirror as a last resort means of setting fire to the cornfield - hopefully attracting someone’s attention in the process.

Service has always been a crucial part of my life, and the main reason why I chose to study biomedical engineering in college. Additionally, I value Theta Tau’s tight network of individuals that strive to grow not only professionally, but as a community that supports one another. Transferring in from a large, public university, I know Theta Tau will help me find my community of tight-knit engineers that will encourage me to become the best version of myself.  ","I’d like to plan a service event for Theta Tau. Specifically, I’d like to work with a local elementary or middle school in the L.A. area that has an afterschool program. The event would be held at USC and members of Theta Tau could create a variety of stations pertaining to their major. For example, BME students could set up an interactive prosthetic hand activity, EE students could do an Arduino activity, and etc. Each group of students would spend approximately 15-20 minutes at each station before rotating until the end, when everyone could come together and discuss what their favorite activity was. The point of this activity would be to expose students to the world of science opportunities and give them a glimpse of life at USC. Snacks could be provided at the beginning to ensure they aren’t hungry during the activities. I believe science outreach is incredibly important nowadays, given that STEM is a huge part of our world. Yet there are barriers that prevent groups of people from being able to experience their full potential, and a service event such as this would help to provide underrepresented students the exposure that is needed to help resolve this disparity. ","Theta Tau’s social pillar is the most important to me. As a transfer from another university, I experienced blatant misogyny from a male-dominated engineering program and extreme competition in all the classes I took. This obvious lack of community was especially disappointing since I think that engineers need to stick together more than anything. Our classes are often difficult and being able to work on a team is essential to any kind of scientific research or internship. As a result, I’ve come to really value community and collaboration more than anything. In the world of STEM, there is a multitude of ways to develop professionally, and many organizations that focus on the service aspect. Yet few appear to value the social aspect, which is why Theta Tau’s social pillar is so important to me. After meeting members of Theta Tau, it’s clear to me that there is a strong support system that strives to create meaningful connections within the organization, from the mandatory group study sessions to the retreat that happens every semester. I know that the social pillar that Theta Tau exemplifies would allow me to find the community that I am searching for in the STEM community. ","Outer Banks, Interstellar, The Hangover","Princess Jasmine from Aladdin would be my closest match. In the film, she’s a headstrong, independent, and blunt woman that has a strong sense of duty. Similarly, my friends have noted my tendency to give very honest opinions and value my alone time. I have a strong sense of adventure and could envision myself exploring and wandering around the city of Agrabah just as she did. Her impulsivity, such as the time she gave an orphan child some fruit without paying, is something I can see myself doing given that I don’t always think about the consequences of my actions. ","I’d focus on the three most important things: food, shelter, and water. For shelter, I’d use the swiss army knife to cut down some of the corn and create a clearing. Once the clearing has been made, I would take down all the pieces of corn and use the corn husks to weave the individual corns together, till I create a mattress of some sort. After creating the mattress, I’d search for a water source by focusing on holes or damp areas in the ground. Using the pieces of scrap wood, I’d dig into those sections to see if any underground water could be found. In case of rainfall, I’d tie the parachute into a rounded upward shape for it to catch any potential water. For food, I’d create a trap by using corn kernels as bait. They’d be placed on top of holes I’ve dug and covered with corn husks, in order to create the illusion of normal ground. Once the animal runs to eat the corn kernels, the false bottom would cause the animal to fall into the hole. Not only would I have fresh meat, but I could also use the strike-anywhere match to create a fire and use the mug as a pot to cook the meat in.

The topics that I've spoken to actives about are all things that I find very intriguing. It's always been amazing to see people from Theta Tau in the classes that I am taking. On top of all, I've been trying to find a community to grow in, which was a major reason behind my transferring to USC, and I feel I can find that at Theta Tau.","I remembered seeing a picture of a beach cleaning drive that Theta Tau had organized during the Spring semester. As soon as I saw that, the first thing that came to my mind was to somehow involving engineering. Theta Tau is an engineering fraternity, after all. So tackling community problems using technology is what I would be getting at with an event if I were to plan one. For example, the beach cleaning drive would be more along the lines of creating a robot that does the cleaning.
So, the event I would plan would be based on a predecided problem and would be in two parts. First, there would be a hackathon within the fraternity to come up with actual solutions for those problems and then working together on implementing the best one. 
So as an example, if we were to help the local family services in aiding the teenagers they are working with to give them better opportunities, I would think of creating a mobile app that could be a less invasive means of communication between the caseworkers and the at-risk individuals. If someone else comes up with a better plan, we work together to implement different aspects of that.","If I had to rank the pillars, I would put Service first, followed by Social, and lastly, Professionalism. Most of the world's problems can only be solved through Service. Professionalism is a necessary evil due to the work environment culture created by way of capitalism. 
My name is a direct Sanskrit translation of ""for the good of others,"" I feel good knowing that; it gives me a sense of purpose to help other people. I know it's just something my parents decided to name me, but I feel very proud of it. 
Service is of most importance to me not just because of that, but because the world as a whole can become a better place to live in if there wasn't such a huge income gap between the richest and the poorest. Call it egoistic altruism if you want, but I would rather we find the cure for cancer faster than indirectly pay for cheap labor and exploit human lives. Humans are made to think and find solutions, not perform menial labor and spend their lives in a job that can easily be automated.","Ready Player One (book), Mr. Robot (TV show), Forrest Gump (movie)","Wade Watts or Parzival from the Ready Player One book is a fictional character that I resonate with a lot. From being laid back when in a relatively constant state of living to buckling down and working hard when in a new and uncertain location, I have done it all in the past and would definitely do it again. Wade embodies hard work and the never-say-die spirit, which are both things that I admire and see in myself.","Finding adequate food and drink, shelter, and fire are my priorities. Food is available in huge quantities all around me, for I am in a cornfield and not a deserted island. Corn is a crop with deep roots, requires significant irrigation; locating the irrigation pipeline would not be a big ordeal, plus I have a mug! I use the planks of wood and a part of the parachute cut out using the Swiss army knife to make a shelter. There is enough corn plant near me to use as kindling for a fire, although I might not need any considering that corn is grown in Spring and the lowest temperatures are around 55F, which is quite pleasant actually.
Now that my priorities are taken care of, I begin to find stuff to while away my time (soccer!), maybe even locate my horse (I do have a lasso, after all). I shall keep the apple as a gift for the horse if I find it or just eat it myself. I guess we'll see.

I've had the pleasure to deliberate over skincare routines with Kevin, banana pizza with Nico, and electric skateboards with Christian. I look forward to discussing even more topics with many more members!

My close friends are more than just a second family — I always ask them first for advice, support, and comfort. I'd be ecstatic to join Theta Tau's family of like-minded, high-achieving engineers, and work together to make a positive difference in the world.","I'm passionate about teaching and giving back — especially inspiring younger kids in a way that I didn't fully experience when I was younger. For the past two summers, I've taught engineering entrepreneurship, python, web development, and more at USC engineering summer programs for students of various ages. I would love to engage with many more students through engineering-related events!

With all this in mind, I would plan an ""Engineering Day,"" similar to Viterbi MESA's ""College and Career Day"" that I volunteered at. K-12 students will be able to engage with actives over fun engineering activities and learn about what college engineering is like.

Each Theta Tau member would lead team events related to their engineering disciplines. For example, one multi-team activity could be building and operating a mini Panama canal. Students can join task forces for building the boats (foil floaters), constructing the locks, and writing code to coordinate the canal's operation. In addition, I would create opportunities for students and active to make meaningful connections, like student-volunteer pair lunch or a walk around campus + Q&A. The best source of inspiration for younger students is interacting with a role model that they identify with!","While I closely align with all three pillars, the Social pillar is the most important to me. My friends are my lifeline, and I gain the most motivation from working with or alongside my peers. However, Viterbi and USC often feel like a huge place, and I still haven't found a tight-knit community to call home on campus. I've quickly come to realize that Theta Tau's purpose, pillars, and people are exactly what I'm looking for.

Over the past week, it's been a pleasure to catch up with Akash and reminisce about the hackathon we won, talk about music with mutuals like Jared, and hear about startup internships from new faces like Carol. I can easily see myself being close friends with every Theta Tau member I've met so far (although Kevin's on the fence xoxo), and I look forward to getting to know everyone even better!

I placed the Social pillar as most important also because I see Theta Tau's social aspect as a through-line across all pillars. I hope to invest deeply in the Professional and Service pillars as well — and the camaraderie with my fellow Theta Tau members will make service and professional development even more meaningful.","Inside Out, Your Lie in April, The Martian","I think Wade Watts (from Ready Player One) represents me in a lot of ways. He is extremely dedicated and detail-oriented — he'll try anything and everything until he solves the problem at hand.

Wade is shy, but he loves his close friends, whom he trusts completely and motivate him constantly. His teamwork with friends is what enabled his success.

After he becomes famous (this is probably where the comparison ends haha), Wade maintains his humility and integrity. In his dystopian world, he uses his wealth to support humanitarian foundations. He can have stubborn opinions but is often willing to compromise.","Unfortunately, my computer science skillset is relatively ill-fitted for a survival-in-the-wild situation. Nevertheless, I have done my fair share of tinkering — and since my family was pretty frugal, I would often only have ill-fitted tools for constructing random gadgets.

Anyways, I'm waffling right now and it's already late afternoon. The first course of action is finding water. I'll hijack the farm's irrigation system by sticking tweezers in the rubber hose and moving it like a lever to control the water flow.

Next up is shelter. I'll form a lean-to against a tree trunk with the parachute and scrap wood. I'll also try fashioning a hammock out of cornstalks and the lasso rope.

Third is food. I'll try making a fire by directing sunlight onto a pile of brush, branches, and cornstalks (the match is a one-time backup). Then, I'll collect corn and carry them back to my shelter with my woven snowshoes. I can eat the corn straight off the cob, mash it up the kernels in the mug with my knife into cornmeal, or steam or grill the corn over the fire.

I entertain myself with whatever's around me all the time — some ideas at the cornfield include tree-climbing, corn bowling with the soccer ball, designing a corn maze, and the age-old how-far-can-I-chuck-an-ear-of-corn game.

Our connections - both professional relations and friendships - seem to be invaluable. They can be the key to helping each other succeed and pursue our dreams, or even making an impact on the world around us, as good engineering often takes a team. Theta Tau helps foster these exact kinds of relationships, allowing us to help each other grow as people through a well-rounded approach to social bonding, giving back to our community, and developing our newly budding professional lives. Through all the recruitment events I’ve attended, I’ve noticed how close-knit, welcoming, and helpful the members of Theta Tau are. I’d love to be part of and contribute to a group like this one, spanning a wide range of majors, hobbies, and personalities, but also united by a strong common passion for what we do and hope to achieve as engineers. ","I’d be interested in planning an event under the Service pillar. When I was part of engineering organizations in high school, our most rewarding service projects were related to helping teach younger kids about engineering and foster their love for design and creativity. LEGO Mindstorms robot kits are great places to start because they’re relatively simple and intuitive to put together, but allow a lot of room for creativity and learning once assembled (since kids have to think about how to make their robot function). I’d want to hold a LEGO Mindstorms event that would take younger kids through (a simplified) engineering design process to construct their robots and possibly hold a mini competition for their robots. They could build and compete in teams. Each step of the way, we could guide them and offer some insight as to how what they’re doing with the robots is similar to what real engineers do. I think the event could be both fun and educational for kids, especially if we can serve as role models for them. 

Another event I think would be fun would fall under the Social pillar. Each person would contribute one unique or out-of-the-ordinary fact about themselves that they don't think anyone else would know, and one person would organize a slideshow containing all of these facts - they’d be the only person to know who submitted which fact. It’s up to everyone else to go through the slideshow together and vote on who they think contributed each fact. Everyone reveals their fact at the end (to prevent any process of elimination)! I’ve played this at a few parties before and it’s been hilarious.","I feel that the third pillar, Social, is the most important to me - not only because I feel that Theta Tau provides a great opportunity to build strong friendships, but also because I believe the other two pillars (which I also find incredibly important) benefit from a strong sense of community. Engineering is a difficult discipline to study, but I have always noticed that some of the most challenging endeavors I’ve taken on have been transformed into my most fond memories when I did them with a close group of friends. What I think Theta Tau does exceptionally well is foster these kinds of friendships, which in turn benefits us in all aspects of college life: academically (through having a strong support system), professionally (through having a strong network and a good group of people to learn from) and, of course, socially. Furthermore, a close-knit group would be much more likely to arrange and facilitate a meaningful service project rather than a fragmented or superficial one; I would love to help organize and take part in service projects, especially when I’m doing them with a group of people who all care deeply about these projects. Ultimately, if I am accepted as a member of Theta Tau, I’d want to contribute to this strong sense of community too, because I know how much I’d appreciate having it and would want to share it with others. It seems to make Theta Tau unique when compared to other organizations on campus.","Little Women, The Martian, and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off","Sokka from Avatar: The Last Airbender is a character who I believe can represent me well (both when I was 5 and first watched the show, and now). Some traits we have in common are that we are fairly outgoing, we value hard work and dedication, we feel a strong sense of loyalty to our friends and family, and we’re not hesitant to take up a new challenge (either in the spirit of fun or for a greater purpose). Like Sokka, I’m not overly ambitious; however, when there is a task at hand, I can band people together, work well in a team, and not only organize but strategize. Ultimately, we’d give our best for a winning outcome.","My first thought would go to procuring food and water - luckily, I’d be surrounded by a plentiful supply of corn on stalks that I could use to keep myself fed (I’m imagining a vast, flat cornfield)! I wouldn’t be as lucky with finding water, however; I’d need to set up a slightly more robust system for water collection. I’d cut a section of my parachute using the Swiss army knife and drape it over some sticks (bowing downwards) so that it could collect water from rain. For a more immediate water supply, I’d collect morning dew from the fields with a small section of the parachute or a shirt and then empty it into my mug. The next important step would be to build myself a shelter. I’d take the remaining section of my parachute and put it over some more sticks (this time, making sure that it doesn’t bow heavily) and tie the makeshift shelter together with the lasso. To boil and purify my water, keep myself warm, and maybe even roast some corn, I’d use my wood for a campfire. If it’s sunny outside, I could use the mirror to start the fire, but if it’s not sunny, I’d need the match. I’d probably eat the apple on the first day when I inevitably get hungry; I don’t imagine it lasting long in the wilderness, so I might as well savor it while I can. 

With basic survival tactics out of the way, I feel that I might get bored waiting around for 10 days. It wouldn’t make much sense in this situation to wander around and waste my energy - but I’m an adventurous person and a cornfield unfortunately isn’t very exciting. To pass the time, I’d make a pinball machine! Using the back of one of the snowshoes as a board, I’d etch little notches into the cloth of the snowshoe to stick whatever stones and sticks I could find to serve as obstacles on the board. The tweezers would serve as the flippers at the bottom of the board. Lastly, I’d use a corn kernel as the ball - it’d be small enough and relatively round! I'll repeatedly drop the kernel in at the top and let it roll down with gravity, propping the board up against another surface, for endless entertainment.

As for the soccer ball, I’m torn as to whether I’d cut it up to use as a bowl for the corn I collect or keep it around as a “companion” (like Wilson from the movie Cast Away).

However, I’m equally eager to experience the smaller charming aspects of daily college life - like late-night discussions with my roommates over tea and midday chats with classmates on walks - that I realized I missed so much during the pandemic when I had to stay home.

Even though there are many similar majors, there is still a great diversity in what exactly people want to study and what they want to do with their lives. Having the core pillars of service, professionalism, and social is exactly what I was looking for when I moved to Los Angeles. Being able to concentrate on just those pillars means a higher emphasis on those professional development, service, and of course social events.","Considering the demographic of the club being mostly STEM majors, it feels fitting to try and expand that love of STEM and encourage kids and young adults to pursue their dreams. I would love to see us go out to schools in the area and put on events that are just like carnivals, but with STEM-based booths. These kind of events will spark kids’ interest in STEM so they can see it as fun and enjoyable rather than just boring work. Ideally, we would do them during the school day to make it most accessible for them. We could do a math-based scavenger hunt around school, a memorizing pi contest, a pie eating contest, math coloring sheets, cool science experiments and demonstrations, and even experiments they can do themselves. Growing up, my schools always had something similar, whether it was specifically science night, or math night, but I think a limiting factor was the fact that it was at night, and I usually did not feel like coming back to school, or my parents were not able to bring me back. To alleviate this, I think it would be good to go during the day. ","The social pillar is the most important to me because it lays the groundwork for the other pillars. The really special thing about Theta Tau is the fact that nearly every person is an engineer in some capacity, which means we may also think similarly and have similar goals in life. These aspects of getting to know people make the professional and service events even more meaningful because they are with people you care about, and want to see succeed. I truly do feel like the service and professional events are even better when you feel connected to those around you. Technically, I could get professional advice from anywhere online, but no one else would have gone through similar experiences in school or networking, and know the little secrets. I love doing service events, but they are even better when you do them with people close to you. You really get to share the experience, and I feel like the people or organization you are service also see the benefit of volunteers getting along and really working well together. Social events really bond you to others, who you would eventually be doing these other things with and make those better as well. ",The Little Mermaid; Alice through the Looking Glass; the BFG,"Ariel from the Little Mermaid, well except for the fact that she was good at singing for a little bit.

We (sometimes) goes against our parents wishes, and sometimes ends up in dangerous situations, but we take the chance to see what is out there. ","In order to survive, I need food, water, and shelter. I would use the parachute as a shelter to protect myself from the UV rays, and maybe as a blanket. I might cut up some of the corn stalks to construct a sort of fort-shelter. I would use the mug to boil water in and the soccer ball just for fun, and possibly a pillow. Once I cut down a bunch of the corn stalks so they don’t catch on fire from a fire, I would leave those out to dry and then use them for fuel. I would also cook the corn for food. I would probably want to try and use the mirror to start the fire since I only have one match, but once I had enough dry corn stalk to continuously burn the fire, I could use the match. I would save a piece of wood to widdle tools if in this world I could figure that out.

I’ve always been surrounded by such similar-minded people that joining a community of unique individuals is something I’ve always wanted to do. As I explored Theta Tau, I came to love the community’s vibe. It feels like a close group of friends that I can always count on, either for help or just people to grab dinner with. I’m honestly just looking for my home away from home, and I hope Theta Tau can become that. ","I would plan an event for the Professional pillar and it would be an event where members shadow professionals at a tech company. I think it’s really insightful for students to at least get a glance of the lifestyle of an industry professional so they know at least what they’re getting into. 

The event would probably look like members going to the company’s site sometime in the morning when they could get a mini tour of the site followed by a presentation of daily activities that go on at the company. Around lunch, the members could mingle with company employees and have a pseudo lunch chat. In the afternoon, the members could then split up and explore the company, asking questions to the employees they’re interested in. Then the event would conclude. 

What would be really cool is if this event was part of a series where Theta Tau took members to a wide variety of companies, from startups all the way to big tech companies. After all, there is a vast difference in the cultures between different companies and it would be awesome if members got a sense of the company culture they thrive in before entering the workforce. 
","Without a doubt, social is the most important. 

Don’t get me wrong: professional is still important; otherwise, I’d be applying to a social fraternity. However, I do value professional, hence my application. 

Yet, social is the first thing that jumps to my mind when asked why I’m applying. Part of it is probably the fact that Theta Tau is a society and there’s a process comparable to pledging to actually get in. In the process, you get inevitably closer to other new mems in your class, whether it’s through study sessions or kickbacks, and you really can’t find another process like that outside of college. 

The result is the best part of Theta Tau in my opinion: the friends you make will be for life. Sure, I will meet people in classes and at parties but it’s the people you always get dinner with and go to retreats with that you will take away with after college. At the essence of it, I want Theta Tau to be my second family that I can grow alongside. 

They always say that you make the friends of your lifetime in college and that’s exactly what I look forward to in Theta Tau.

Day 1-2:
I am stranded in a Kansas cornfield, writing on some natural paper and pen that I found in nature. I picked some corn and ate it but raw corn tastes horrible. Who knew? Used my cup to drink some water from a hose but staying alive at least. 

Day 3-4: 
So bored here. Managed to start a fire by shining the mirror on wood and cooked corn tastes significantly better. Have taken up cornfield art with my swiss army knife but have no idea what I’m doing. Laid down wood and corn stalks for a makeshift bed frame and the parachute is my blanket.  

Day 5-6: 
Upgrading slowly. Tied snowshoe laces to part of my parachute to make a kite which was pretty fun for 10 minutes. Finished my cornfield art but I saw a UFO soon after. Fed apple to a rabbit that I have now tamed - we are now soccer bros. 

Day 7-8:
Getting better. One week anniversary here so I lit a big fire with a match and had roast rabbit (it got too good at soccer). Anniversary present was the snowshoes, which I discovered were Louis Vuitton so I treated myself. 

Day 9-10:
Last stretch. Decided to explore the cornfield a bit by cutting the lasso and laying a string trail behind me. It was still all just corn. Why am I even in Kansas in the first place? Think I may have gone a bit crazy in the past few days.

Interns at startups are often given very important tasks and responsibilities that lead to incredible learning experiences. Now, I believe that regardless of whether or not one wants make a career out of startups, working with a startup or two can be invaluable. 
I interacted with over 200 USC startups and am connected with many more outside of USC. These startups are willing to hire and work with engineers of all backgrounds. I would create a fair for these startups to come in and hire Theta Tau members. Beyond that, I would create a database for these startups to interact with Theta Tau on a regular basis. As internships become incredibly exclusive, I think this would be a fantastic way for members to get internships and gain experience!

I would love to be in a community filled with other Viterbi students who can relate to what I am studying, bounce ideas off of each other and even study together!

In the show, Loki is constantly searching for his “glorious purpose.” Personally, I am not too sure about what I want to do in the future, I have a lot of interests and want to work towards something that I believe in. Loki likes talking to people and is energized by conversation. While in the other movies, he may come off as a mischievous saboteur, he realizes that he is actually just really interested in being with people.  ","There are a couple of things that I would immediately start to work towards. Shelter is incredibly important. I need to survive for 10 days, which means that I would need some sort of shelter. I would use the swiss army knife to cut the corn plants. I would weave the corn stalks together to form a makeshift tent. The primary purpose of this would be to retain some heat and have some form of shelter. Additionally, I would use the knife to convert the parachute into a makeshift sleeping bag. With that, I have a basic form of housing. 
I would then focus on getting some food. I’ve an apple to satisfy my hunger immediately. I am surrounded by cornfields which would provide me with some nutrition. Given that I recognize the area, I know that I there are raccoons, rabbits and opossums in the region. I would use the lasso and swiss army knife to hunt some of these animals. This would provide me with food for the next ten days. 
My last concern is getting water. Since there are cornfields all around me, there is water. I would fashion a makeshift shovel out of the wood and use it to dig down till I found water.

The event would be a fun day at the beach with games and food. I chose this event despite it being quite basic and common, because I think it is nevertheless an extremely effective team building despite its simplicity. The games I would plan would be team based mini games that involve everybody collaboratively. One example is a game where each team stands in a line, and see which team can pass an onion ring (or any kind of ring snack) from one end of their line to the other. The catch is that the onion ring must be passed without using hands, so everyone gets a chopstick that they bite on with their teeth and passes the ring using it.

Being from Singapore, which is a much smaller city with less poverty and social problems, it was a shock to me when I first came to LA and saw the inequalities that exist here. The most shocking was definitely seeing the amount of homeless people here, because there are so few homeless in Singapore. This made me feel very guilty and angry at first, because I thought it was such an unfair situation to be in. I realised then that I have a social responsibility to fulfil, not only because I came from a better off place, but also because I am a student at USC. The students at USC are the brightest and kindest people I have ever met, and so many of them are also passionate about giving back to the surrounding LA community.

This would be enough for food and water because corn has a lot of moisture. I’d occupy the rest of my time by playing soccer. If I’m not lucky, then I’d have to find my own food. My best bet for water would be morning dew, which I would collect using the mug. Food would be the next problem. I’d try to find any wild animals and cook them with fire. I’d cut the match into halves lengthwise using the swiss knife so I can cook multiple times if needed. Since it is a cornfield, there’s plenty of leaves that I can start a fire with, provided that they are very dry. If not, I’d use the wood. If I can’t find food, however, I’d have to be very creative. The apple would last me about 4 days, in which time I’d have to create a hot-air balloon. The parachute would serve as the balloon, and the rest of the materials would be for the fire. My idea would be to use the two snow-shoes and the wood to form a square where the soccer ball can fit. This would then be connected to the ends of the parachute via the lasso. I’d then put on the parachute, start the fire to burn the soccer ball, and then hopefully start flying. ",,"Meeting new people and exploring LA!

Also, since this is my first time ever in LA and the US, I’m excited to explore this city for all it’s Hollywood hype and eat all kinds of amazing food. ",Yes,Sep 9th 1300,he/him

However, Theta Tau, being an engineering fraternity, would make it easy to find students who have similar interests and goals as me. As such, I can make connections that'll stay with me during and after my time as a Trojan.  Moreover, I can grow not just socially but professionally as well. I feel like the things that Theta Tau offers, such as mock interviews, would be of massive benefit to my career and help me feel more comfortable as a future professional.","One thing I would hope to be able to experience is touring a company’s campus/work environment. This is especially meant for some of the younger members of the organization since many of them have very little physical experience in professional environments. This helps demystify what the modern work environment looks which may seem alien to underclassmen. I also think actually getting to see where people work can get people more invested into pursuing their career goals as it gives them a physical goal to work towards. Touring also offers a supplement to the tech talks by adding another dimension to really envisioning yourself at a company. If a physical tour is not possible, a virtual tour could be a great alternative (especially nowadays). Moreover, virtually touring different companies would allow members to see what type of environments they prefer and where to wish to work at. Either way, I think getting a taste of what an actual jobs looks like would be a great learning experience for some members.
","While the social pillar comes into a close second for me, I feel like Professionalism is the most important pillar of this organization. While there are many other social fraternities on campus, Theta Tau’s emphasis on professionalism and engineering is one it’s main draws to me. The professional world can be intimidating for many undergraduates and having a great support system like Theta Tau can make my experience all the more enjoyable. Things like the mock interviews stood out to me because I think being good at interviews and people skills in general are not something you can just study for and need actual practice. Events like tech talks and faculty dinners also seem like another way I can get up to speed with the industry. Outside of actual professional events and workshops, I think being surrounded by people that are very capable and already have professional experience can act as my tour guides for navigating the professional world and making sure I don’t get lost.",Garfield/Evangelion/Introduction to Programming with C++ (Third Edition),"One character I connect with on a deep level is Ferb from Phineas and Ferb. As someone on the quieter side, I’ve always respected Ferb’s silent demeanor. Salient, yet mysterious, Ferb was the most enigmatic figure in the whole show. While he seemed shallow and robotic on the outside, he was one of the smartest, and sometimes bravest characters on the show. I like to see a little bit of myself in Ferb一maybe not the most outgoing of people but sharp when it really counts. Ferb’s even shown a bit of musical aptitude with his occasional performances throughout the show.","Whenever these sort of hypothetical survival situations are brought, the first thing you need to think about is water. Fortunately (or unfortunately), I’m surrounded by corn which means there must be water nearby. If for some inexplicable reason this cornfield is irrigated then I'll have to resort to eating the corn itself. Obviously food isn’t going to be much of an issue considering where I’m trapped, I’ll just have to deal with the extra carbs later. With food and water out the way, I’ll have plenty of free time to do something productive, except I have nowhere to sleep. Thankfully, I’ve watched a lot of Youtube videos consisting of guys building random structures in a jungle somewhere so I’m basically a professional. Hopefully the swiss army knife found came in extra large as I’ll get to chopping down corn stalks to act as building materials. With all of the stalks I’ve cut down, I should be able to assemble the basic skeleton of a sad hut. You can’t have a house without a roof though. Thankfully, the parachute can seal my chateau and insulate so I don’t freeze to death. To stop myself from getting lonely, I’ll install the mirror near me so I’ll have some company. By now my 10 days are up and I can finally go to somewhere that isn’t named Kansas.",,"With my first year of USC being completely behind a computer screen, getting to explore campus and interact with living breathing human beings is a very appreciated change of scenery. Moreover, I am looking forward to joining more clubs since outside circumstances the last two semesters made it a bit more difficult. Whether it be in engineering ones like this or more recreational ones like the climbing club, clubs are something I am looking very much forward to. Either way, I am happy to finally be on campus and being a college student. ",Yes,"Sept 8, 1:00pm",He/him

Being surrounded by such a community could push me further than I could go on my own. I also don't really know much about what I want to do in the future, and the opportunities Theta Tau offers in the profession sector would be invaluable. It's also a great way to make friends, I didn't know anyone at USC when I moved in so the social aspect of Theta Tau would be helpful as well. Plus the name is cool.","In the service sector, I would plan an event to expose local middle school/high school students to the engineering at USC. It would likely be a single day pop up fair concept, with booths/stations and food and music, where students can see different career paths in a more approachable setting. There would be booths/stations for each engineering major at USC, and volunteers would come up with fun ideas to make them interactive. For instance introducing majors through board games or videos, or showing attendees the details of projects USC students are working on/are interested in, or creating models/demonstrations of what a career utilizing different majors would look like. I know that when I first became interested in stem careers in high school it was very intimidating to try to explore these career paths, thinking they were for people who were smarter than me, but it is because of open-houses and events that I went to in high school that made engineering a more approachable and reachable goal that I am here now. ","Professionalism is most important to me mainly because I have no experience in that area. I have some idea of what I want to do after college and I know that I should be taking every opportunity to explore my options now, but I don't even know where to begin. I chose computer science because I felt it would likely be the most versatile major in terms of possible career fields I could go into after I graduate, but the professional opportunities Theta Tau provides would be beyond helpful for me. ","Psych, Words of Radiance, Inception","Xialing from the new Shang Chi Marvel movie represents me in the way that she strives to prove herself. I was a very athletic kid, my parents out me and my older brother in all of the same sports programs and though I was talented enough to keep up, I never felt accepted or good enough. There were many times when I was told by many family members that because I'm a girl, I shouldn't be playing sports, and though, unlike Xialing, I was actually given opportunities to train and perform, it was still extremely challenging to push through the doubt placed in my mind telling me I couldn't do it. Pushing through this has given me a drive to prove wrong those who tell me I can't do something. ","I would find a few (3 or 4) closely planted sturdy corn plants, clear the plants around those 3 or 4 and use that to pitch a tent with the parachute. I would place the parachute over the corn with the remaining plants in the middle. I would use the swiss army knife to carve pegs out of the scrap wood, and then use the pegs to secure the edges of the parachute. I would use the swiss army knife and the tweezers to tightly weave a floor mat for my shelter and baskets for rain collection out of the corn husks. I would save the corn to eat. The weaving would take at least two days (I'm speedy) so that would take care of two days of entertainment. I would save the match for an emergency. Then I would just hope for it to rain and for the rain to be drinkable, catch the rain in my mug and the baskets I've weaved and then save it to survive the 10 days. I would use the remaining pieces of scrap wood to build a mini wall, digging a hole in the ground with my hands and securing them in the ground. I would pass the soccer ball back and forth with myself against this wall as entertainment. ",,"I am really looking forward to learning more about computers/programming (I have always been really interested but still only have a novice understanding of basic concepts.) I look forward to feeling at home here, finding close friends that I really vibe with.

Theta Tau seems like a really exciting place for me to get comfortable at my new home here at USC and meet people who have similar passions and ambitions. I also really want to develop as a person by learning to build relationships with my peers in an environment of people who want to work in the field of engineering. The specific network that Theta Tau offers is something I really want to be a part of and help expand as an active member. ","I think I would plan an event where Theta Tau members would team up to teach school children about rockets. The science behind it and how to make them. Then, a competition with the students where they launch their rockets and then the students would vote on which group was the best at teaching the science. This way we could give back to the local community and we could evaluate ourselves as team members and teachers. ","I really like how Theta Tau puts a strong influence on Professionalism. I highly value service and social as pillars in life but I think the emphasis professionalism in the specific setting of college is crucial in getting us ready for the real world. At this stage in life, I think professionalism is an underestimated attribute and the earlier it is developed the more we can advance ourselves in the workforce. ",Big Bang Theory/Harry Potter/,"I feel like Woody from Toy Story would best represent me because I value loyalty as one of the most important qualities a person could have. Woody loves and stands by Andy even when the world around him changes so much and as people grow older but he had a desire to never lose hope, which is quality I try my best have when things get tough. ","I think I would take the parachute, tie it up, and put the the soccer ball at the bottom of it. I would light the match below the parachute and set fire to the ball to make some sort of hot air balloon flare in order to get the attention of others. In the mean time I would have to use the knife and apple to hunt and get food for the ten days, and then I would use the mirror to direct the sun to cook whatever I got. Whatever shelter, table, or stand I would need, I would have to use the pieces of wood for and a lasso to hold everything together.

I am curious but also nervous as to how difficult my classes will be and so I am really anxious about my first round of exams here at USC.

Unlike traditional engineering clubs that are centered around a certain goal, Theta Tau is just a diverse community of people passionate about engineering who help one another pursue their careers and have fun.","As I am from the LA, I would plan a social event that would introduce everyone to some of my favorite hobbies that you can only do here. Although there would be a lot of logistics involved like transportation and food, I would try to get everyone to go skiing, surfing, and rock climbing all in a single day. I think that this would be challenging, but a good bonding and learning experience for everyone.  ","I feel like service is the most important pillar to me. As a group of smart individuals who love to create things, I believe that there is a lot that we can give to this world through small charity drives to creating large scale applications like a platform to help connect people from different cultures together to help disseminate prejudices and stereotypes.

While I hold myself extremely accountable, I have a community of like minded individuals around me pushing me to grow to thank for many of my achievements. I feel that Theta Tau presents one such community; a place where I would be pushed to grow along with also being able to push others to grow as well. I believe that the members of Theta Tau would understand the issues and struggles I would face as an engineer.","During my time in India and Bangladesh, many of our service events were geared towards not only helping out impoverished communities, but also building meaningful relationships with the members of those communities. If I could plan an event, I would have an educational event based on introducing kids to basic engineering concepts. This would encourage an interest in the children from a young age. Furthermore, the event would be structured in a small group setting. What I mean by this is that one active would have a small group of children, and along with teaching them some engineering concepts, they would also spend some time with the kids doing some fun activities based on those concepts. This would bring a social aspect into the event.","I would say that professionalism is definitely the pillar that is most important. This prioritization is due to my inexperience in the field. I have always been passionate and involved in service throughout my life. Additionally, I am extremely extroverted and social. However, when it comes to endeavors such as interviews and the professional side of computer science as a field, I am relatively clueless. I often find myself wishing that I had someone to ask for advice regarding applying to internships or research positions. Interacting with fellow engineers who have gone through the same apprehension and processes as me presents an opportunity to learn in a welcoming environment. I believe that Theta Tau’s focus on professionalism would not only help me fill this gap in my knowledge, but also gain a degree of confidence. Hopefully, this would also help me succeed in securing said internship and research opportunities.","Fresh Off the Boat, Whiplash, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping","I feel that Pi from The Life of Pi represents me quite well.

I see myself being at that point right now. While I do see myself as resilient and logical, I definitely have lot more to learn. Additionally, I think I am quite open-minded like Pi is. I could definitely make a friend out of a tiger. ","First, after rationing my water I would eat the apple as it would most likely rot within a few days. Second, I would cut the insulation out of the snow shoes and use them along with the mug to collect any rain water that might fall. Eating the surrounding corn should provide an adequate source of food. 
In terms of keeping myself entertained, I would take the shoelaces from the snow shoes and use them to tie the two pieces of scrap wood together. Then, using the lasso I would tie the parachute to the aforementioned pieces of scrap wood. After collecting what I saw as an acceptable amount of corn crops, I would use whatever remained of the lasso to tie the corn together, hold it over my head and light the corn on fire with the match. Hopefully, this would allow me to achieve some lift like a hot air balloon and fly.",,"I most look forward to being able to participate in the clubs I am passionate about.
